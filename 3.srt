- <i>Give me a new house</i>

<i>Toady, toady, I'll give you an old house</i>

00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,835
<i>We will build you a house</i>

6
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,128
Mom.

7
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,298
It's raining.

8
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,342
- What? Is it?
- Let's go home.

9
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,804
Those scary men must've left by now.

10
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,516
Ki-baek, how about we sing the song
just two more times?

11
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,187
Dad will come and get us once they leave.

12
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,857
I'm a blue belt.

13
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,610
If you get scared, I can protect you.

14
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,240
No. If you see those scary men again,
pretend you don't know them.

15
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,203
If you ever run into them,
just tell them you do not know me or Dad.

16
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,289
But lying is bad.

17
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,672
Lying isn't always bad, Ki-baek.

18
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:16,386
If you have to lie to protect me
and your brother, it's not bad.

19
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,388
You're a big brother, Ki-baek.

20
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,766
You can do that, right?

21
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,353
Yes!

22
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,315
<i>At first, it started with a white lie.</i>

23
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,193
My parents are very busy, so I don't think

24
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,529
they can attend
the parent-teacher conference.

25
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,322
<i>It wasn't even about anything big.</i>

26
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,074
Your mom called.

27
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,202
She told me she and your dad work
in the countryside.

28
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,870
She was very worried.

29
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,042
I told her to put her worries to rest
because you're so good at everything.

30
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,545
From your tuition fees
to your lunch money,

31
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,547
there are ways to get practical help...

32
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,050
Jesus, that was
a long-ass counseling session.

33
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,511
Hey, top student.
What is this, special treatment?

34
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:58,971
Let's go.

35
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,473
By the way, Ki-baek,
is it true your tutor tells you

36
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,850
what to expect on every test?

37
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,893
This punk will never tell you.

38
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,562
I think he also goes
to a cram school in secret.

39
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,108
<i>I either didn't correct
people's false assumptions about me</i>...

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,986
Hey, newbie.

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,780
Where do you live?

42
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,199
I live in this area.

43
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,743
You do? Where?

44
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,996
Over there.

45
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,416
Nice. Do you live with your parents?

46
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,919
No, my parents have their own place.

47
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,713
Where do they live? Gangnam?

48
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,173
I knew it.

49
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,010
I thought you looked like you came
from money, you know?

50
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,595
Nice.

51
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,973
<i>I just gave people
the answer they wanted to hear.</i>

52
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,933
- Bye.
- Did you go to school in this area?

53
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,498
{\an8}Are you heading out?

54
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,668
{\an8}I bought another bed.
Stop being stubborn and just use it.

55
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:16,882
{\an8}I'm already so grateful that you let me
crash here from time to time.

56
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,843
I'll take care
of this month's maintenance fees then.

57
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:23,138
The maintenance fees here are
way more than your monthly salary.

58
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:28,185
Just look after my car and this place
when I have to work abroad, okay?

59
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,693
You're hosting the news next week.
You need to look dashing.

60
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,987
This is a bit much.
I'm still new, you know.

61
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,199
You should wear expensive clothes
so you can have it easier at work.

62
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,368
The office is like a battlefield.

63
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,079
Wear good armor,
and no one will dare to mess with you.

64
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,914
Everyone will want to be your friend.

65
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,083
Call it the art
of protecting yourself, socially.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,001
All right?

67
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,923
<i>Swallowing what you want to say
and saying what others want to hear.</i>

68
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,762
<i>I mean, that's not a bad lie, right?</i>

69
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:11,979
THE ART OF PROTECTING YOURSELF

70
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,649
EPISODE 3:
THE ART OF PROTECTING YOUR HEART

71
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,067
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

72
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,861
Ki-baek!

73
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,913
What just happened? Am I hurt?

74
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,999
Am I alive right now? What is this?

75
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,004
Ms. On! Are you all right? Are you hurt?

76
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,172
Are you alive? I mean, are you okay?

77
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,051
I said it was dangerous.
I told you to stay away. We nearly died!

78
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,095
Have you gone totally insane?

79
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,471
What did you say?

80
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,266
- Have you gone totally insane? Get a grip!
- What?

81
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,767
You can't seem to snap out of it.

82
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,854
Whenever I see you like this, I feel bad
because I feel like it's my fault.

83
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,981
God, why are you being like this?

84
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,277
Well, I mean...

85
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,905
Why did you try to jump into the water?

86
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,492
I had no intention of jumping, whatsoever.

87
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:12,581
That's why I said it was dangerous
and told you to stay away, numerous times.

88
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,583
Because of you, we both slipped and fell!

89
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,376
We nearly died!

90
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,379
Also, you asked me if I'd gone insane.

91
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,256
What I have is called disinhibition.

92
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,176
It means I can't control
my emotions or actions.

93
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,845
I'm sick! That is what the doctor said!

94
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,723
Is it very serious?

95
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,268
Do they have to open your skull?

96
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,897
My head is about to split in half
because of you. Do you hear me?

97
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,231
- What?
- Fine.

98
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,650
If it's difficult for you
to pretend not to know me

99
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,904
because of your personality,
let's just be total strangers.

100
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,865
Don't follow me. Really, don't.

101
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,992
Seriously.

102
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,832
What a freak.

103
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,092
Where is he?

104
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,385
My phone got all wet
and isn't even working now.

105
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,596
God, Yoon Ji-hu.

106
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,062
What is this? What a mess.

107
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,189
Seriously, what is this?

108
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,110
But I saved someone's life...

109
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,904
Whatever.

110
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,743
This is nuts.
My car seats will get all ruined.

111
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,954
Damn it.

112
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,125
Huh?

113
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,631
What?

114
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,133
What now?

115
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,844
The car's gone.

116
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,638
The guy I came with
vanished without a trace.

117
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,225
Okay, so?

118
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,519
Well, practically everyone
in the country knows me,

119
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,313
thanks to the unsavory incident
that happened recently,

120
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,150
so I cannot use public transit.

121
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,736
What are you, a top-tier celebrity?

122
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,781
So?

123
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,200
Give me a ride.

124
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,662
You know it's absurd, right?
The two of us and this situation.

125
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,623
Let me get a ride, please.

126
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,128
Fine, get in.

127
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,798
Wait!

128
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,593
It's brand-new. I haven't even made
my first payment yet.

129
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,220
Are you going to push the car
down the road instead of driving?

130
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,974
Well, I would if I could, but I can't...

131
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:37,976
That's right.

132
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,776
Korean wrestling.

133
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,278
What?

134
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,530
I mean, I'm good at it.

135
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,866
This won't do.

136
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,452
Oh, yes. This will work.

137
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,872
I can't wear this.

138
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,332
Right, you can't wear this.

139
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,666
That won't even fit.

140
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,628
I've got something for you.
I have something you can wear.

141
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,728
{\an8}MEN ON THE RUN

142
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,567
I thought you guys only played ball games
on <i>Men on the Run</i>.

143
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,153
Well, we played all sorts of games
in the early days.

144
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,409
Why do the youngsters
these days like cropped tops so much?

145
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,494
Isn't it uncomfortable?

146
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,082
Let's wear our own clothes.
I'll pay for you to wash your car.

147
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,961
They're soaked in salt water.
It won't wash out.

148
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,921
Just find your own way back then.

149
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,966
What kind of psycho
walks around like this?

150
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,050
FULL OF LOVE

151
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,678
Do you know what I had to go through
to find this costume?

152
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,304
Here, have some water.

153
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,764
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

154
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,685
Isn't it about time
you took off that spandex suit?

155
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,353
You're supposed to be
the ideal son-in-law.

156
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,648
What put me on the map when I was trying
to decide between music or variety TV?

157
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,735
This saved me from nearly ruining myself
while trying to keep up with Young-woong.

158
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,153
- Do I look cute?
- Sure do.

159
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,906
Are you going to take on
Director Jang's new show on GBS?

160
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,908
- Nope.
- What about the MBS pilot?

161
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,118
No, I won't do it.

162
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,331
I see you're busy posting photos
of yourself in that spandex suit.

163
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,417
Oh, "On Woo-ju, JBC"?

164
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,544
"On Woo-ju"? You mean the writer?

165
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,047
Is she doing a JBC show?
Did they confirm a time slot for it?

166
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,882
They will if I do the show.

167
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,886
You're expressing your interest in a show
that hasn't even been confirmed yet?

168
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,805
- I need to put this wig on you.
- Okay.

169
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,766
Just wait. I'll explain
what's going on once I know for sure.

170
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,314
Ms. On, are you all right?

171
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,484
Your face looks pale.
It looks blue, actually.

172
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,694
I'm fine.

173
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,740
Hang in there. There's no traffic,
so we'll get home in no time.

174
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:02,287
Anyway, why did you go up there?
I don't think you were trying to drown.

175
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,123
Just because.

176
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,920
Normally, I never do things for no reason.

177
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,507
But these days, I can't help it.

178
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,179
I remember thinking to myself,
"I want to look down at the ocean."

179
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,599
The next thing I knew,
I was already climbing the rocks.

180
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,439
Ms. On, are you really okay?

181
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,523
I'm fine.

182
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,485
I don't have indemnity insurance.
I can't get into an accident.

183
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,447
Let's pull over onto the shoulder.

184
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,575
Yes, right here. Slow down.
That's it. Careful.

185
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,746
I'm really okay.

186
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,791
Do you accumulate points
for repeatedly saying that you're okay?

187
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,544
You keep saying you're okay
when it's obvious that you're not.

188
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,255
But you keep saying, "I'm not okay,"
I mean, "I'm okay"?

189
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,592
Huh? Ms. On.

190
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,762
Ms. On Woo-ju?

191
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,514
What?

192
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,681
Hey...

193
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,392
Ms. On Woo-ju. Hey...

194
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,360
Help! Over here!

195
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,986
We need help!

196
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,947
Sir, open your eyes.

197
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,200
- What happened?
- He suddenly collapsed while on a trip.

198
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,332
Man, she clearly isn't okay.

199
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,502
Excuse me.

200
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,423
- My little brother is...
- Hold on. One moment.

201
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,967
Are you all right?

202
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,380
Oh, you woke up.

203
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,258
What's with the blanket and the mask?

204
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,886
I don't want anyone to recognize me.

205
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,307
Anyway, who's that boy?

206
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,766
I don't know.

207
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,019
Hey, worry about yourself first.

208
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm okay.

209
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,399
Help!

210
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,443
He's not breathing.

211
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,570
Help!

212
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,406
Please save him.

213
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,950
Hey, kid. Are you all right?

214
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,627
They told me to wait until Mom gets here,

215
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,254
but my brother is sick.

216
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,597
Once upon a time, a famous man
named Confucius said this.

217
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:12,227
"When in need, birds can peck the grain,
dogs can bite people

218
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,106
and people can lie."

219
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,985
- Pardon me?
- What do you think you should do

220
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,029
to grab people's attention?

221
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,865
You saw that earlier.

222
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,163
Oh, boy.

223
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,754
You had temporary hypothermia.

224
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,340
We brought your temperature
back up to the normal range.

225
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,592
You can go home once the drip is finished.

226
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,469
Thank you.

227
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,937
I really am okay now.
You can go. Get going.

228
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,482
Hey, you need to lie down.

229
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,278
Wait until the drip is finished.

230
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,864
My goodness.

231
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,707
Wow, nice place.

232
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,837
It's your fault that this happened,
so I won't thank you for the ride.

233
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,339
Can you drive yourself home?

234
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,508
Oh, sure.

235
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,179
You can go.

236
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,230
You had hypothermia
and had to go to the emergency room.

237
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,774
Do you not eat? What are you, a kid?

238
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,027
You're as light as a feather.

239
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,862
Cover your stomach. It's cold.

240
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,616
I'm off.

241
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,659
Wait, Mr. Song Ki-baek.

242
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,121
Thanks for your help earlier.

243
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,936
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK'S
FIRST NEWS SEGMENT

244

Her name is...

255
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,750
I can hear it.

256
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,836
Su...

257
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,088
A?

SU-A, GU-WON

You see, I know everything.

260
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,269
I pray my mom will never have
to work late again.

261
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,230
I'm home.

262
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,149
You're home.

263
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,568
- Did you have dinner?
- I'm not hungry.

264
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,575
- You need to give him a proper meal.
- You look a mess.

265
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,243
What's that? A wrestler's belt?

266
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,203
Oh, this is the latest trend.

267
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,041
I told you not to teach him these things.

268
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,835
Grandma Bok-ja knows everything.
She really does.

269
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,423
The two of you will ruin everything.

270
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,093
- What?
- The tower's on fire,

271
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,887
and it's been struck by lightning. Whoa.

272
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,601
I'm going to wash up.

I sincerely promise you

290
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,769
that I'll only report the truth

<i>This is Song Ki-baek.</i>

God, what am I going to do now?

294
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,116
What are you talking about?
We have so many things to do.

295
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,536
Just get them together in one place,
and we'll have tons of things to do.

296
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,122
"We Live Together."
This will work, I'm telling you.

297
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,415
But the thing is--

298
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,417
Think young people prefer to live alone?

299
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,920
Kids these days are lonely
and want to be around people.

300
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,796
That emotional ambivalence...

301
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,925
- We'll satisfy their conflicting needs.
- Hey, emotional what?

302
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,384
Be quiet.

303
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,137
- I get that, but--
- It's okay if it feels familiar.

304
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,307
If the setting and cast are different,
we can craft fresh stories.

305
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,850
Hey, Ms. On.

306
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,354
What did the chief say?

307
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,984
Don't add or take out anything.

308
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,527
Tell me verbatim.

309
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,742
"It's outdated. She's lost her touch.
No one will want to be on the show."

310
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,580
Me?

311
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,044
Shake, shake, shaking my head.
I'm hopping mad.

312
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,420
Shall I go ballistic on her?

313
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,799
- What?
- It's "Shake, shake, I'm so mad.

314
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,592
Do you have a death wish?"

315
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,843
Be quiet, okay?

316
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,555
It's what youngsters say these days.
You need to learn these things.

317
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,231
It feels so damp in here.

318
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,108
What are they, moles?

319
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:06,909
Anyway, speaking of which,
we're understaffed and--

320
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,162
Bonjour!

321
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,541
Hello.

322
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,130
My goodness, Ha-young is here.

323
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,011
I thought we were meeting tomorrow.

324
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,138
- You came a day early.
- Yeah.

325
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:30,850
It's been a while.

326
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,311
Yes. Hi.

327
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,776
{\an8}<i>You're my adorable honey bunny</i>

328
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,946
{\an8}<i>I'm your raccoon</i>

329
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,282
{\an8}I'm Na Yu-jeong, your beauty manager.

330
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,575
Here, take one.

331
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,286
I do house calls too.

332
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,830
Give me a call.
They're skincare products. The best!

333
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,540
Give me a call.

334
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,084
You rock, lady. Stay healthy.

335
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,047
<i>Wherever we go, we're stars</i>

336
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,340
- We're Mr. and...
- Ms. Popular!

337
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,260
- <i>Let's hold hands and have some fun</i>
- Na Yu-jeong, beauty manager.

338
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,846
<i>Spin, spin, spin around and look cool</i>

339
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:09,764
Look cool!

340
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,933
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, I see no one but you</i>

341
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,353
<i>Hop, hop, my adorable lady</i>

342
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,607
<i>Come to me, softly and quietly</i>

343
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,777
Stop drinking that thing
and pack some rice cakes.

344
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,487
Rice cakes? Why?

345
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:28,365
This is Ki-baek's favorite rice cake.
He likes it steamed and grilled.

346
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,117
He'd rather have this than rice.

347
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,246
Should I call him to come
and pick up the rice cakes?

348
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,040
<i>Make way, all of you, here I come</i>

349
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,834
Hello, I'm Na Yu-jeong,
your beauty manager.

350
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:53,641
Thanks.

351
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,685
- Are you the newbie?
- Hello.

352
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,104
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

353
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,439
You said their pre-recording was today.
You can go.

354
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,774
Oh, thank you.

355
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,193
Being supportive
of the newbie's fan activities?

356
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,904
I heard you were in a tight spot.
Guess that's not the case.

357
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,865
I-na, you can get going.

358
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,283
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

359
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,828
Well...

360
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,249
Ha-young is joining the team.

361
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,377
Chief went through hoops to persuade her
as soon as she returned to Korea.

362
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,507
Woo-ju as our head writer
and Ha-young to back her up.

363
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,300
Now we have nothing to worry about.

364
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,264
After my divorce,
I lived in Cali for a year,

365
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:36,600
then in Paris the following year,
so has it been about two years?

366
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:37,977
Yeah.

367
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:41,605
You haven't changed one bit.
You still have such fair skin.

368
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,817
You must've spent
all your time planning shows.

369
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,154
What are you talking about?
It's because I use an expensive sunscreen.

370
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:51,490
Haven't you been watching TV?
I've worked on a number of shows.

371
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,411
Better keep up. You'll lose your touch.

372
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,955
I only watch shows that do well.

373
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,625
I feel like my brain is rotting
when I watch unpopular shows.

374
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,798
I was so happy for you
when you left the team

375
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,718
to jump on the opportunity
to work as a head writer.

376
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:14,305
Nice to see you after just two years.
It's like my runaway child is back.

377
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,725
And that runaway child can pull
the family out of the gutter now.

378
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,102
Who is she, really?

379
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,771
Writer Lee Ha-young.

380
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,358
- But who is she?
- The legendary newbie.

381
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,029
The uncontrollable, unimaginable,

382
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,114
and the worst newbie.

383
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,282
HOMETOWN REPORT AT NOON

384
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,533
Gwangju in Gyeonggi?

385
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,160
TV CREW

386
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,329
It's Gwangju in Jeolla.
How could you confuse them?

387
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,206
You said you scouted a school there.

388
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,751
There's a school
with the exact same name in Gyeonggi.

389
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,252
What should we do?

390
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,421
Call city hall and ask if we can shoot.

391
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,341
Find out if we can do
something like a pottery experience.

392
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,593
Stay out of the senior writers' sight.

393
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,388
If someone says something to you,
just keep talking on the phone.

394
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,098
Hey, hide.

395
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,936
<i>That's how the legend began.</i>

396
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,690
What should I do? You see, this is...

397
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,983
Woo-ju.

398
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,278
Woo-ju!

399
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,988
- Pour them in here.
- Okay.

400
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,240
Sorry, we'll be quick.

401
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,408
- Hurry up and pour.
- Okay.

402
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,868
Hey, Ha-young.

403
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,705
What? You forgot their passports?

404
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,499
You've got to be kidding me.

405
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,670
<i>Woo-ju had just graduated
from newbie status,</i>

406
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,173
<i>so she had a lot on her plate too,
but Ha-young was really something.</i>

407
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:35,219
<i>She always had Ha-young right by her side,
like a mother hen nurturing its egg.</i>

408
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,136
It's not that heavy.

409
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,639
<i>But if they struggled
and learned things together,</i>

410
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,849
<i>shouldn't they be pretty close?</i>

411
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,184
<i>What's with those two?</i>

412
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,729
<i>Woo-ju trained Ha-young so well</i>

413
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,316
<i>that Ha-young got an offer
to be another team's head writer.</i>

414
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,902
Woo-ju was getting ready
to debut as a head writer too.

415
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,363
Not long after she had assembled the team,

416
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,781
Ha-young suddenly left.

417
00:26:56,699 --> 00:27:00,286
When Ha-young was a subwriter,
she was a legend in a different sense.

418
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,706
She had a knack for casting
and had brilliant ideas.

419
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,876
Let's get along, okay?

420
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,088
<i>If I were Woo-ju, seeing her again
would make me uncomfortable.</i>

421
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,965
<i>Will Woo-ju be all right?</i>

422
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,808
Hey, have you grown taller?

423
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,644
I've got a casting meeting.

424
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,105
Oh, they've agreed to meet you?

425
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,149
Yes, of course. Who'd turn me down?

426
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,861
Have some coffee before you go.

427
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,119
My ears feel clogged.

428
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,789
This is way too high for me.
I feel like I'm getting motion sickness.

429
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,334
I told you we should call first.

430
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,836
The security guard always treats us
like we're solicitors.

431
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,088
My goodness. Be quiet, will you?

432
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,343
What? He could be home now.

433
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,220
That's exactly why.

434
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,056
Do you think he'd want to see us?

435
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,932
He has a lot of pride, you know.

436
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,225
Just hang this here.

437
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,771
You want to leave without seeing him
after coming all this way?

438
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,824
What are you doing?
You can't see anything through that hole.

439
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,350
He took it.

440
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,851
Let's go.

441
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,279
I won't even eat this stuff.
Why do they always...

442
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,698
This is good.

443
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,080
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK'S
FIRST NEWS SEGMENT

444
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,879
One plus one equals...

445
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,299
Two. Damn it.

446
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,846
Song Ki-baek isn't screwed--

447
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,142
I'm screwed.

448
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,768
It's not working.

449
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,314
Man, it's not working. What is going on?

450
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,944
I'm sorry. Oh? I'm sorry.

451
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,362
{\an8}DONKEYS THE DODGEBALL KINGS

452
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,280
{\an8}What is this?

453
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,115
It worked, right?

454
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,575
It did work a few times.

455
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,954
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

456
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,539
- Have you lost your mind?
- Oh?

457
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,126
Ki-baek. What are you doing?

458
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,382
WRITER ON WOO-JU

459
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,052
Where are you?

460
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,637
What?

461
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,890
I'm at Forever C&C.

462
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,100
Why do you ask?

463
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,519
Huh?

464
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,229
What's with this guy?

465
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,858
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm on my way now.

466
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,068
Just tell them
I'm running a few minutes behind.

467
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,069
Hey, Mr. Kwak.

468
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,447
- Gosh, what the--
- Finally, I get to see you.

469
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,324
Hey, you're still here?

470
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,076
Come on. I waited for you, as I should.
Hey, Mr. Kwak.

471
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,829
We've been through
thick and thin together.

472
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,122
Could you help me, please?

473
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,045
I'll accommodate your schedule, pay,
food preferences, mood and lifestyle.

474
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,505
What do you say? Are you in?

475
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,381
Listen, Woo-ju.

476
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,759
If I want to live, I must eat and poop.

477
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,011
I don't eat
because I have no time to poop.

478
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,721
And I can't poop because I don't eat.

479
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,556
I won't take up a lot of your time.

480
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,059
Ms. On, I hear you're having a hard time.

481
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,395
You haven't even secured
a time slot for it yet.

482
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,857
You expect me to do
<i>We Live Together</i> just to help you?

483
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,359
No, no way.

484
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,860
I want to live at my place.

485
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,111
Let's go to my place.

486
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,739
- Hey, come on.
- Writer On Woo-ju.

487
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:12,204
I came over here to see
if it was really you, and here you are.

488
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,331
- Hey.
- Sorry to interrupt.

489
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,875
You're not interrupting.

490
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,294
You haven't been
in the office for a while.

491
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,421
I'm supposed to have a meal
with the CEO today.

492
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,589
Oh, really?

493
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,715
Anyway, Ms. On.

494
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,218
It's so hard to get a meeting with you.

495
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,179
- Sorry?
- I told you I wanted a casting meeting.

496
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,598
- Well...
- A casting meeting?

497
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,394
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

498
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,064
Hey, Jeong-heon. Woo-ju.
Let's go grab a coffee or something.

499
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,607
No, Mr. Kwak.

500
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,610
I get what you're trying to say.
I'll be in touch.

501
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,655
Come on! Hey.
Don't be all business with me.

502
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,534
Drop the "Mr." Just call me Beom. We good?

503
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,871
Beom, I'll be in touch then.

504
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,956
Call me, Woo-ju.

505
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,295
Hey, Jeong-heon.

506
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:05,632
We're represented by the same agency,
so we'll be like a package deal.

507
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,175
You get the idea, right?

508
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,553
Shall we do it?

509
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,724
But if I'm the main item,
I don't need a freebie to seal the deal.

510
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,768
- What's with you?
- I'll see you around then.

511
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,186
Let's do it!

512
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,397
- That's not even funny. Don't do that.
- Hey, but...

513
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,236
Huh?

514
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,367
Did you call me after a few days

515
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,703
and ask me where I was
to come and find me?

516
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,539
I think I've figured it out.

517
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,624
Figured out what?

518
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,752
That mysterious link
between inhibition and disinhibition?

519
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,129
Do you mind putting it in layman's terms?

520
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,382
Hey, come here.

521
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,554
I'm not in the mood to joke around
with you today.

522
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,640
Well, I'm dead serious right now too.

523
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,683
All right, what's three times six?

524
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,771
Eighteen.

525
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,855
What?

526
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,607
I mean, I'm 20...

527
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,901
I'm 40.

528
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,196
I'm 33. Damn it.

529
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,031
What the heck are you saying?

530
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:15,035
Whenever I saw your face in the past,
I got this strong feeling and felt okay.

531
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,788
Was this not the reason?

532
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,331
Why not?

533
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,750
God. Let go, will you?

534
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,301
<i>It's my son-in-law!</i>

535
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:34,846
<i>Hop, hop, my adorable lady</i>

536
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,849
Why is he your son-in-law?
He's everyone's dream son-in-law.

537
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,060
Goodness, isn't he so cute?

538
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,937
He's well-spoken and a great dancer.

539
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,231
Your daughter works
at a broadcasting station.

540
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,565
Ask her if you can see him.

541
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,528
I asked her to get me his autograph,
and she flat out ignored me.

542
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,321
That brat is such a snob.

543
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,406
But you know what?

544
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:56,410
Every time I see him,
I feel like I know him personally.

545
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,247
He and Ki-baek went
to high school together.

546
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,164
- Huh?
- What?

547
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,874
<i>Your forever soul mate</i>

548
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,712
Again? You didn't have to bring anything.

549
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,131
It's nothing compared to
the peaches you gave us.

550
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,382
Anyway, thanks.

551
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,595
- The front gate works now.
- Okay, thanks.

552
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,681
Hey, Un-baek.

553
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,349
Did you know that Ki-baek

554
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,852
and Kim Jeong-heon were friends
in high school?

555
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,521
"Friends"?

556
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,148
<i>Here comes your raccoon</i>

557
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,232
I doubt that.

558
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,485
Do you guys know each other?

559
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,239
I believe you said hi to each other
at the award ceremony too.

560
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,284
Oh, we went to high school together.
We're friends.

561
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,661
We just went to the same school.

562
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:45,792
Back in high school, Ki-baek was
the top student, and he was athletic too.

563
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,377
He was perfect in every way.

564
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,964
Are you talking about yourself?
You were Mr. Perfect.

565
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,467
You were athletic and rich,
and you had lots of friends.

566
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,136
That is true.

567
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,596
Go on and catch up, you two.

568
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,264
- No.
- No, wait.

569
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,060
What are you doing? Let go.

570
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,733
Wait, it's weird.

571
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,780
- Woo-ju.
- Just go. I'm not interested.

572
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,511
MADAM ON

573
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,558
{\an8}HANGUK MILK
STRAWBERRY

574
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,277
I bet you got chewed out again
or something like that.

575
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,322
If you're upset about something,
just sleep it off.

576
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,574
Why do you have to make such a fuss?

577
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,035
Nothing gets resolved
if you just sit around.

578
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,286
I must do something.

579
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,748
Then while you're at it, wash these too.

580
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,217
YEON

581
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:21,138
- What's up?
- <i>Hey, why didn't you tell me?</i>

582
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,431
<i>I hear Kim Jeong-heon has taken the bait.</i>

583
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,518
"Taken the bait"? What is he, a fish?

584
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,437
On Woo-ju.

585
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,481
Hey, Woo-ju.

586
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,279
So you have no interest in me. About that...

587
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,784
- But aren't you here to work?
- Yeah, exactly.

588
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,954
So, why did you have to butt in
and ruin everything?

589
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:49,332
You think I ruined your project?

590
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,211
I am Kim Jeong-heon, you see.

591
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:59,759
I'm genuinely interested in your new show
as a show host, not as your ex-boyfriend.

592
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,764
So decide wisely. You're a pro.

593
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:15,025
I pulled all sorts of antics
to do a good job but got no work done.

594
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,527
I'm so embarrassed.

595
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,798
You can promise me
you'll keep it to yourself, right?

596
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,385
It's crucial that I get to the bottom
of it if I want my job back.

597
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:46,264
A doctor must keep
his patients' personal info confidential.

598
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,142
But this is no hospital.

599
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:52,103
I suggest making an outpatient appointment
in the afternoon.

600
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,439
Is it possible though?

601
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:59,486
You mean, symptoms of disinhibition
suddenly disappearing or returning?

602
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,489
That's right. So I tried to look
for some patterns, but...

603
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,241
Well, that failed.

604
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,952
It could be caused
by an imprinting effect.

605
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,829
If a certain situation
or action at the time of the incident

606
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,706
left a lasting imprint on your mind,

607
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:16,044
it could turn your symptoms on and off,
like a switch.

608
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,756
So you're saying there's a switch
I don't know about inside my head?

609
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,341
Now I'm even more confused.

610
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,303
Hey, don't do it like that.

611
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,347
Watch me, okay?

612
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,849
- One second.
- Fold it over.

613
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,435
Pick it up using the center point,
then shake it once.

614
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:39,234
I have a problem staying calm because
I don't know when the symptoms will come.

615
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,864
What if the switch turns on
when I'm at work tomorrow?

616
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,869
It'll be helpful for you
if you can find out what that "switch" is.

617
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,874
For now, let's wait and see how it goes,
while hoping it won't turn on again.

618
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,670
All right.

619
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,474
SONG KI-BAEK

- Hello.
- Oh, yes. Hello.

- Hello.

- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

LOOKING FOR A NEW FACE
TO HOST JBC NEWS 8

625
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,926
- He couldn't hold back?
- He should write an apology.

626
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,553
What's he going to do?

627
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,222
He'll get fired at this rate.

628
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,933
Hello, Mr. Kim.

629
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,520
I'm back, as of today.
I apologize for causing you concern.

630
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,024
What?

631
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,235
What do you want?
Go do what you need to do.

632
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,320
Yes, sir.

633
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,199
He came to work? Wow, he's got thick skin.

634
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,576
Those who should voluntarily resign
never do.

635
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,661
Mr. Kim. I'm here.

636
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:19,584
Hey, Mr. Choi! Give me a hug.

637
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:21,795
So you're back?

638
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,130
Yes, after completing my job
at the overseas branch.

639
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,925
Nae-jeong, it's been so long.
You look great.

640
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,135
I thought you were coming next month.
What a surprise.

641
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,053
Plans changed.

642
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,554
- Let's sit down.
- Welcome back.

643
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,765
- You need a chair.
- I brought you something small.

644
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,393
You didn't have to get me anything.
Oh, cookies?

645
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,436
I didn't have time
to pick out proper gifts.

646
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,231
- Guys, eat up. They're all cookies.
- Have a seat.

647
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,943
- Open this and have a taste.
- Sure.

648
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,736
So, how have you been?

649
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,239
- I've been well.
- So you're back for good?

650
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,157
- Yeah.
- Not going someplace else?

651
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,242
Where?

652
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,453
This makes me so happy, seriously.

653
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,747
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK

654
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,249
SONG KI-BAEK: SUSPENDED

655
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,676
We'll start drinking in broad daylight
and drink until we drop.

656
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,553
- I'm done for the day.
- Okay.

657
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,721
- Have a great time.
- Join us if you can.

658
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,890
- What shall we eat?
- Pork bone soup would be nice.

659
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,892
Pork bone soup, it is.

660
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,357

664
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,084
- <i>He's really something.</i>
- <i>Way to go.</i>

665
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,253
<i>What's he going to do if he gets fired?</i>

666
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,589
- <i>He's brazen.</i>
- <i>If I were him, I wouldn't come.</i>

667
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,132
Go do what you need to do.

668
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,787
Mr. Song Ki-baek.

669
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,168
You're breaking out in a cold sweat.

670
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,961
Are you all right?

671
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,341
Hey. I asked you if you were all right.

672
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,679
Come on in.

673
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,265
Over here.

674
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,809
Come this way.

675
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,146
Wait, can we come in here
without permission?

676
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,316
There's no shoot until the evening,
so it's fine. Sit here.

677
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,609
Okay.

678
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,569
You can't stay here.

679
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,238
We have to change the desks.

680
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,865
Oh, you have to change the desks today.

681
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,034
Come here. It's okay.

682
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,292
They definitely don't need this set today.

683
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,919
We have to dismantle the set.

684
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,922
Oh, that's why they're dismantling it.

685
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,342
Well, come with me.
I know of another studio.

686
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,856
About yesterday. What was that?

687
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,442
You said you'd figured out something
but made no sense.

688
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:32,944
It was nothing.

689
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,864
- Do I have food on my face?
- Nope.

690
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,160
I do. Why did you lie?

691
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,291
I guess you feel like your normal self,
seeing how you can lie like that.

692
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:52,922
- Thanks for the food.
- You barely touched it.

693
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,091
I have to go. Throw this out for me.

694
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,345
Mr. Song.

695
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,515
Just sit down for a moment.

696
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,979
Maybe it's not a bad thing
that you've become so honest.

697
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,023
It could be helpful for you.

698
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:13,234
The moment the switch turns on,
I turn into a ticking time bomb.

699
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,780
But does that "switch" really exist?

700
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,032
Is it turned on now?

701
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,118
I think it's off.

702
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,786
But you're so honest right now.

703
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,498
You already saw everything.
I don't need to hide it from you.

704
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,125
Oh, right.

705
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:31,919
You know...

706
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,717
Do you think I can host a news show?
I mean, in this state.

707
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:42,555
A news show? That might be a little too...

708
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,557
Right?

709
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,019
You see,

710
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:53,733
I've put up with everything and held out
until now to be a news anchor.

711
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,237
There were so many false rumors about me,

712
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,573
and I used them

713
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,827
because I wanted everyone to think
that position was rightfully mine.

714
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,503
Ki-baek, what does the news mean to you?

715
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,679
To me, it means...

716
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,647
I'm not sure.

717
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,236
I have to go. I'm sorry.

718
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,446
Ki-baek.

719
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,201
I don't really know what's going on,

720
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,287
but I do know you're going through a lot.

721
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,792
But if you let yourself get depressed,
it'll only make things worse.

722
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,378
You have to cheer yourself up
during tough times.

723
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:56,462
Okay?

724
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:01,801
I'm struggling because I've got no energy,
but I'm supposed to cheer up?

725
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,974
You know what self-defense is.
Protecting yourself physically.

726
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:11,352
But do you know what's more important
and powerful than that?

727
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,355
The art of protecting your heart.

728
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,067
You must protect your own heart.

729
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,695
"The art of protecting your heart"?

730
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,293
- Is the team dinner at Bongbong Pub?
- Yes.

731
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,130
But Mr. Kim said everyone
who reports to him should be there.

732
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,549
Let's just go.

733
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,479
BONGBONG? BONG...

734
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,953
Hey, Song.

735
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,124
I was going to call
but thought you might be here.

736
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:16,250
And here you are.

737
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,688
LOOKING FOR A NEW FACE
TO HOST JBC NEWS 8

738
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:46,864
Hello.

739
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,324
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

740
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,451
- Hi.
- Hello.

741
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,039
Oh, Ki-baek--

742
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,128
Look at you, Song Ki-baek. I knew it.

743
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:04,090
He's trying to cheer himself up
even though he's got no energy.

744
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,633
I should cheer up too!

745
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,304
{\an8}APPLICANT: SONG KI-BAEK
APPLYING FOR: JBC 8 NEWS ANCHOR

746
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,898
Hey, Ki-baek. Come out.

747
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,444
Did Mr. Kim tell you to audition?

748
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:29,031
Rumors are running rampant
that Mr. Choi is getting the position.

749
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,866
They asked rookie announcers to audition

750
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,411
so it'd look like
they had enough applicants.

751
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,704
What are you doing here?

752
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,582
For God's sake, hey.

753
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,628
It's a total shit show. It's all rigged.

754
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:47,174
No one will say anything even if
you ditch the audition and leave now.

755
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,468
Mr. Kim is just using you.

756
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,345
- I know.
- Then why are you here?

757
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,722
I must do this.

758
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:57,435
I have to let him use me this time
to seize my next opportunity.

759
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,478
Hey, Ki-baek.

760
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,646
I will do it.

761
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,273
I have to.

762
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,572
Here for the audition, Ki-baek?

763
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,952
- Let's both do our best.
- Yes.

764
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,629
This way, please.

765
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:28,924
- Hello.
- Hi.

766
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,136
- Thank you.
- We're ready for the third applicant.

767
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,805
Jin-ju, we need the script.

768
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,974
Over here.

769
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,829
Who's next?

770
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,790
Number three, Song Ki-baek, is next.

771
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,416
Song Ki-baek?

772
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,626
NAME: SONG KI-BAEK

773
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,754
Hey, isn't he

774
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,547
<i>that guy from</i> JBC News at Noon?

775
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:12,301
<i>When I think about
what I had to do to clean up that mess</i>...

776
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,805
<i>But I admit I laughed my head off
when I watched that clip afterward.</i>

777
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,723
Guess there weren't a lot of applicants.

778
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,475
I just see a bunch of losers.

779
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,936
Let's make this quick. Give him a cue.

780
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,830
All right. Ready?

781
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,374
Will you wait if I'm not ready?

782
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,627
Pardon me?

783
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,880
All right, ready.

784
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,264
Hey, On Woo-ju.
You're going to make the floor collapse.

785
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,226
Even when I start my morning feeling good,
it doesn't even last half a day.

786
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,896
JBC NEWS 8 ANCHOR AUDITION

787
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,285
Camera, we're rolling.

788
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,203
You can start when you're ready.

789
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,790
<i>But seriously.</i>

790
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,251
<i>Who told Song Ki-baek
he could participate in this?</i>

791
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,461
This is just embarrassing.

792
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:30,087
Who's emb--

793
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:34,341
- Embarrass...
- <i>Come on. He can hear you.</i>

794
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,843
<i>So what? Who cares?</i>

795
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,887
It's not like he'll get
the anchor position.

796
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:40,681
<i>Hey, let's make this quick.
Let's not waste our time.</i>

797
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:42,808
Who's embarrass--

798
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:44,894
Embarrassing...

799
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,063
Number three?

800
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,776
You can start. Please start.

801
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,582
One moment.

802
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,266
The switch is turned on, isn't it?

803
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,980
Neither of us knows how to turn it off,

804
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,359
but I know that this audition is
very important to you.

805
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,655
I asked you what the news meant
to you, remember?

806
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:41,534
I think you're here because you know
the answer to my question.

807
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,872
Remember the art of protecting your heart?

808
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,794
Protect your heart.

809
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:55,422
You're the only one here
who can protect yourself.

810
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,219
Excuse me.

811
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,805
Can't you see we're holding an audition?

812
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:07,309
I'm sorry. I'm his stylist.
I just noticed that his tie was crooked.

813
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,812
Sorry about that. All right.

814
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,230
- Please get out.
- I'm sorry!

815
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,607
One, two, one, two.

816
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,863
Mr. Song. Do you want to continue?

817
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,489
Yes.

818
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,158
Get ready again.

819
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:47,182
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to <i>JBC News</i>.

820
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:53,105
<i>The National Human Rights Commission
and the Journalists Association of Korea</i>

821
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,733
co-published the <i>2023 Human Rights
Report Casebook</i>.

822
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,693
This was done in compliance

823
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,321
<i>with the Human Rights Practices
Reporting Standards,</i>

824
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:04,617
which were enacted in 2011 and amended
in 2014 by the two organizations.

825
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:07,536
Since the COVID-19 pandemic,
standards on reporting infectious diseases

826
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:10,873
and human rights practices
have been strengthened...

827
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,751
- Well, I must say, not bad.
- Right?

828
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:17,338
<i>It reflects the media's neutral gaze
on the reporting of sex work.</i>

829
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:20,758
The media outlets' heated competition
over viewership ratings has resulted

830
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:24,094
<i>in reckless reporting,
which has been an issue lately.</i>

831
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,930
<i>All eyes are on whether</i>

832
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,974
<i>the media's efforts to shift away
from such trends will be fruitful.</i>

833
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,810
Song Ki-baek, <i>JBC News</i>.

834
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,192
We'll move on to the anchor briefing.

835
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,950
NS-2 ANCHOR BRIEFING

836
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:50,037
Why was Choi Nae-jeong suddenly summoned
from the overseas branch?

837
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,332
The higher-ups flipped out
over the main news' rock-bottom ratings.

838
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,794
Choi Nae-jeong has a huge fandom.
It all comes down to business.

839
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,714
<i>We need ads and better ratings.
The news must be marketable to be saved.</i>

840
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,591
<i>Man.</i>

841
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:06,303
<i>What happened to the honor
and dignity of the news?</i>

842
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,181
They all know
such things do not exist here.

843
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,809
Actually, I bet they aren't
even interested.

844
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:16,313
Look, that's why he volunteered
to be part of this shit show.

845
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,946
Ki-baek, what do the news mean to you?

846
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,493
To me, it means...

847
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,963
A city with a beautiful name, Bangkok.

848
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,424
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

849
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,093
<i>As adults,
it is our duty to protect children.</i>

850
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,971
And it's important to pay attention
in your day-to-day life.

851
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,310
<i>To me, the news is...</i>

852
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:03,610
<i>In my life filled with lies,
it was the only real thing.</i>

853
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:07,614
Ki-baek, what do you want to be?

854
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,992
You get good grades, you're popular.
I'm so jealous.

855
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,660
How am I going to support myself?

856
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,245
Ki-baek isn't like you.

857
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,913
I'm sure he already has a plan.

858
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,416
Hey, Ki-baek, what do you want to be?

859
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,296
Announcer.

860
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,215
I want to be an announcer.

861
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,801
NEW ANNOUNCER TRAINING
IN SESSION

862
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:35,267
{\an8}I sincerely promise you that I'll only
report the truth and never lie to you.

863
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,728
{\an8}Song Ki-baek, JBC.

864
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,857
Here, I don't have to lie.

865
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,818
No, I must not lie.

866
00:56:57,498 --> 00:57:01,752
NS-2 ANCHOR BRIEFING

867
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:26,568
I cannot lie.

868
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,156
Truth, fairness and justice.

869
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,576
I trust that news programs devoid
of these values aren't worth existing.

870
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:44,336
That is the reason I must be
a man who cannot lie,

871
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,758
and the reason why I've decided
to leave this corrupt news studio

872
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,553
that reeks
of such a disgusting, rotten stench...

873
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,515
which I cannot stand any longer.

874
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,792
Let go of me! What did you say?

875
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,878
I let a loser like you audition, and what?

876
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,963
What's rotten? What stench?

877
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,506
You little...

878
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,180
What?

879
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:40,517
You.

880
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,645
You stink.

881
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,568
You rude bastard!

882
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,612
Oh, no.

883
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,300
Where do you think you're going?

884
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,552
Hey! You little...

885
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,304
If you leave now, you'll get fired.

886
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,430
<i>Woo-ju.</i>

887
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,559
<i>Today, my heart and my dream...</i>

888
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,853
<i>I managed to protect both.</i>

889
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,944

<i>Thank you.</i>

891
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:43,288
Un-baek, don't let it drop like that.

892
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:46,208
Here, like this. <i>Taekwon!</i>

893
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,834
- Now you try.
- <i>Taekwon!</i>

894
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,754
- Okay. Pow!
- Pow!

895
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:53,215
I knew it. You are a genius. Well done.

896
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,009
- Mom!
- Mom.

897
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,763
Mom, want me to teach you too?

898
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:00,973
No, thank you.

899
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:06,645
Mom, I will protect you, Dad
and Un-baek once I get my red belt.

900
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,483
Self-defense moves.
My master said he'd teach me those too.

901
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,693
Gosh, you.

902
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,278
Self-defense moves!

903
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:21,743
You see, before you become
someone who is physically strong,

904
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,163
I want you to be someone
who's mentally strong.

905
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,499
It's important
to protect yourself physically,

906
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:31,712
but protecting your heart
is more difficult, and it's more precious.

907
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,302
I will protect your heart.

908
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,054
Your heart.

909
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,141
I'll protect your heart too.

910
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,226
Goodness, my babies.

911
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,105
All right. Ki-baek, Un-baek.
You can do it.

912
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,189
Yes, we can do it!

913
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,274
- We can do it!
- Yes!

914
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,358
We can do it.

915
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,654
- Let's go.
- Let's eat something delicious at home.

916

Okay, we'll have a nice dinner.
