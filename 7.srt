{\an8}KIM JEONG-HEON

3
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:09,858
{\an8}THE DAY WE GOT MATCHING GLASSES

4
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:19,660
{\an8}8 YEARS AGO

5
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:27,709
JEONG-HEON, WOO-JU

6
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:36,218
Coming.

7
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:42,015
Oh, is Jeong-heon home?

8
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:47,563
I'm his mother.

9
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:51,233
Hello.

10
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,111
{\an8}Here.

11
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:59,408
{\an8}Oh, right. I don't live here.
It's our anniversary today,

12
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:02,327
{\an8}so we decided to stay in
and have a steak dinner.

13
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:04,746
{\an8}It's fine.

14
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:08,041
{\an8}It's cute and cozy here.

15
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:13,213
{\an8}I tried calling him on my way here
but he didn't pick up.

16
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,340
{\an8}I see.

17
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:19,386
I'm not one of those overbearing mothers.

18
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:20,304
Right, I know.

19
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:25,851
{\an8}JEONG-HEON
WHERE ARE YOU? YOUR MOM--

20
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:30,939
Jeong-heon rarely calls me first

21
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:33,275
but he called me a few days ago.

22
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:39,740
He said he wanted to get married.

23
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:47,748
{\an8}WHERE ARE YOU? YOUR MOM'S HERE

24
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,835
I haven't even introduced myself properly.

25
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,963
I'm On Woo-ju.

26
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:07,017
Yes.

27
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:09,603
Oh, right. Yes. Got it.

28
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,857
Choi Yu-yeong.

29
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,860
I didn't think
she was the type to run away.

30
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,029
- She's really gone?
- She's gone.

31
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:20,030
What about Woo-ju?

32
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,283
She said she could be hiding somewhere
and went to look for her.

33
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:27,287
Do you think we can bring in
one of the finalists?

34
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:31,750
We can't leave the spot vacant
because Yu-yeong had such a big presence.

35
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:35,587
We can't, unless we can put
the filming on pause for a bit.

36
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:37,881
We've already gone over budget.

37
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,049
{\an8}COUPLE'S PARADISE

38
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:44,930
You thought Ki-baek and I
would choose Yu-yeong,

39
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,682
so now that's gone down the drain.

40
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:53,063
The outcome is predictable
with Cho-hui alone.

41
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:55,232
You need someone
to challenge his first love

42
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:58,902
for Kim Jeong-heon to complicate things
and form a love triangle, right?

43
00:03:58,902 --> 00:03:59,820
That way,

44
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,115
you can use Kim Jeong-heon's face
in your teasers and in the end too.

45
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:07,536
Just say what you want to say
instead of beating around the bush.

46
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:09,997
I've got an idea.

47
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:16,253
There's someone who will
definitely ignite a spark in my eyes.

48
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,221
On Woo-ju.

49
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:40,110
That is crazy talk.

50
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,612
I say it's crazy to leave
the situation as is.

51
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:45,991
Who cares about his first love
if he's not into anyone else?

52
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:48,910
- She's just another new girl.
- What do you suggest we do?

53
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,537
Have a writer come on the show?

54
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:54,374
It'll cause controversy.
People will think the show was rigged.

55
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:55,417
I can't handle that.

56
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:57,044
Of course, it'll cause problems,

57
00:04:57,627 --> 00:04:59,338
so we should handle it in advance.

58
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:04,843
Remove her name from the credits
as head writer and from the crew.

59
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:06,261
She'll be one of the girls.

60
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:09,264
Ha-young, you're a writer too.

61
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,558
How could you suggest that so easily?

62
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:14,353
You can't make
a rational decision right now,

63
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:15,520
so I'm doing it for you.

64
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:17,272
Ha-young.

65
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:18,190
I'll do it.

66
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:21,651
Not you too.

67
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:24,446
Yeon, we can't let this show
go down the drain too.

68
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:26,573
How many people do we have on the team?

69
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,951
I'd rather have my name removed
to make a great show

70
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:32,162
than fail and hear that
I've lost my touch.

71
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:37,376
Everyone who should know this is my show
already knows it.

72
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:46,218
This was totally unexpected,
so we ask for your understanding.

73
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:54,142
Everyone on the production team knows
how serious you've all been about this,

74
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:58,271
so the last thing we want is
to see it all go to waste.

75
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,649
This will be in the show too, won't it?

76
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,567
That's why they're filming this, right?

77
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,361
Can't we just keep it as is?

78
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,322
Why Ms. On, of all people?

79
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:09,741
That's--

80
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:11,993
She and I dated in the past.

81
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,253
Yes, Ms. Ma.
Sorry for calling you so late.

82
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:23,421
The show is all about seeing how you react

83
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,882
when faced with your past love

84
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:29,219
and someone you like now, you know?

85
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:32,722
She's a part of my past
but she could be someone else's present.

86
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:34,891
I think it could be interesting.

87
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,440
It'll generate a lot of buzz.

88
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,694
- Right, Cho-hui?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:48,363
But it seems like a risky move.

90
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:50,157
A writer appearing on the show?

91
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:52,868
She'll be removed from the writing team,

92
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:55,829
and we'll revise everything she worked on.

93
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:00,000
It'd be boring to leave the spot vacant
but if someone totally new joins,

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,837
it could cause a headache,
and we don't want that.

95
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:06,548
It's not a bad idea.

96
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:07,716
It sounds fun.

97
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:09,301
I'm all for it.

98
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:14,097
- What? It's better to keep things as is.
- Be quiet. Just say yes.

99
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:22,063
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:24,482
For what?

101
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:29,571
For not being able to take care of you
as the writer when I dragged you here.

102
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:30,989
I'm not a kid.

103
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,991
You don't need to take care of me.

104
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:35,994
I gave you some pointers
to help you survive

105
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:38,330
the wild variety show jungle

106
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,040
but I can't do that anymore.

107
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:44,336
What's with that scoff? I'm dead serious.

108
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,589
Well, thanks to you,

109
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,674
I now feel pretty confident on set,

110
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,803
and I feel like people are opening up
to me as well, so I'm happy.

111
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:57,682
See? It's all because I taught you well.

112
00:07:57,682 --> 00:08:00,310
I already know I owe it all to my tutor,

113
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,896
so you can stop boasting.

114
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,861
You know this is no joke, right?

115
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:12,697
They squeeze you and hang you out to dry.

116
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:15,367
People in showbiz
aren't called jerks for nothing.

117
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,996
I don't think we're that bad.

118
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,585
Let your pupil give you some pointers too.

119
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,715
If you feel nervous
in front of the camera,

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,221
close your eyes, and for three seconds,
think of what made you happiest recently.

121
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:41,476
It's what I used to do
when I presented the news.

122
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:47,023
It looks like you're taking
quite the risk to do this,

123
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,110
so I hope it all goes well.

124
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,697
All right?

125
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:55,865
Good night then.

126
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:08,044
- Okay, guys.
- All done.

127
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,589
- Yes, chef.
- There we go.

128
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:15,885
Louis's special kimchi fried rice.

129
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:19,097
Ta-da! <i>Bon appétit.</i>

130
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:22,267
Wow, it looks delicious.

131
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,060
You're the best, Louis.

132
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,230
It's lovely kimchi fried rice
filled with Louis's love.

133
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:34,279
Seong-jun, do you like kimchi fried rice?

134
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:47,500
Thank you.

135
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,378
Thanks for the food. I'm digging in.

136
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:51,421
- Let me.
- Yes.

137
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:54,090
Oh, thank you. Enjoy.

138
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,884
Hold on. Ms...

139
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,138
I mean, Woo-ju.

140
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:01,473
Yes?

141
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:03,725
Could you pass me the tissues?

142
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:05,435
- Tissues?
- Let me.

143
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:06,853
Here you go.

144
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:09,356
Min-gu, don't forget
to replace the tissues--

145
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,778
Oops, I mean...

146
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,334
Thanks for the food.

147
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,336
All right.

148
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:34,005
- Oh, let me. I'll serve.
- It's okay. I got this.

149
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:35,340
All right.

150
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,927
- I'm sorry!
- Oh, no.

151
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:42,305
It's all right.

152
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:44,933
I'm fine. It's okay.

153
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:48,436
Use wet wipes.

154
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:49,979
- Thank you.
- No problem.

155
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:54,234
What's the matter with her?

156
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:56,528
She couldn't look more awkward,

157
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:58,780
she faces the camera every 30 seconds.

158
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:05,787
But we got one useful shot.

159
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:06,788
What?

160
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,418
<i>Let me.</i>

161
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:18,800
I'm sorry!

162
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:20,802
Are you all right?

163
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:22,429
I'm fine.

164
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,806
It's okay.

165
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,767
I mean, look at those two.

166
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,189
Woo-ju, you can do it!

167
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:37,068
You'll now play a game
to decide your partners.

168
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,654
The guys will pick
one of the girls' belongings.

169
00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:41,739
Choose one that speaks to your heart.

170
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:45,118
- All right, go.
- Wait.

171
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:46,453
- I'll go first--
- I'll go.

172
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:47,495
Can I go first?

173
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:48,913
Great.

174
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:19,360
What is this?

175
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,447
Anyone know what it means?

176
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:29,787
Then I'll go for this one.

177
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,503
Good luck with Cho-hui.

178
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:47,680
Have some food and then play.

179
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:58,942
DO NOT CLIMB

180
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:10,578
All right. If you're done,

181
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:12,330
we'll now head over to the beach.

182
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,626
You'll team up with your partners
and play this game.

183
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:17,752
Let's go!

184
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:19,420
Let's go.

185
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:46,364
The couple that comes in first
can go out on a date.

186
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:47,532
Get ready!

187
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:50,660
Be careful.

188
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,955
I've always wanted to do this.

189
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,000
We're ready.

190
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:09,637
Go!

191
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,223
Hold tight!

192
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,690
- It's stuck. Come on.
- Hurry.

193
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,525
Hold on, wait.

194
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,403
Let's go!

195
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:37,248
Let's go a little faster.

196
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:41,753
Hold tight.

197
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,391
- Come on. Quick!
- We've caught up with them.

198
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:56,851
We're here.

199
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,394
Let's go. Come on.

200
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:00,730
Get down!

201
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,149
- Hurry!
- Knees on the ground.

202
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,484
Get down!

203
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,694
Let's go, come on!

204
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:08,905
I have a better idea.

205
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:10,823
- Where?
- Lift me!

206
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:12,617
Get on my back.

207
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:13,910
- Okay.
- One, two, three!

208
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,788
- Lift me up!
- That worked.

209
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,832
To your right.

210
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:22,502
Hurry!

211
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,179
- We won!
- We did it!

212
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:42,438
We won!

213
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:47,068
She's so cute when she's excited.

214
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:49,195
What?

215
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:54,242
We won!

216
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:03,418
{\an8}ONE DATE
BY COUPLE'S PARADISE

217
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:12,260
I'm sure the production team
gave us this so we could go on a date

218
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,220
but you want to use it on your own?

219
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:18,016
I get it. I understand.

220
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:21,561
I understand you don't want to go
on a date with me. All right.

221
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,854
Thanks for understanding.

222
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:25,732
But I can't let you take this for free.

223
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:28,943
I haven't done anything yet.
I need this to do something.

224
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:31,237
Well, I need this for a reason.

225
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:40,705
Well, then...

226
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,917
Why are you so obsessed with games?

227
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,128
People call me
Ms. Game Addict of Sangam-dong.

228
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:49,380
But do we have to do this in the sun--

229
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,302
Did you just slap me?

230
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,596
I got one on your face.

231
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,252
Well, I'm sorry.

232
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,046
I really need it.

233
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:49,357
Hey.

234
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:54,862
Oh, your mother wants to see me?

235
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,074
I can't really talk right now.

236
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:01,786
I'll call you back later. All right.

237
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:07,375
Gu-won.

238
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:09,961
Have you called your mom?

239
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,588
- Yes, she said she'd pick us up.
- Mom!

240
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:16,634
Goodness. Look at that. I knew it.

241
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:19,095
My gosh.

242
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:21,430
Hey, sweetheart. You must be exhausted.

243
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:23,808
Why did you bring--

244
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:27,395
Ask me why I'm here,
and I'll stitch your lips together.

245
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,064
You're always shabbily dressed on set.

246
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:32,316
You're going on a TV show
looking like this?

247
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:34,402
At least you're not in a wrestling belt.

248
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:37,363
Shabbily dressed? Come on.
My clothes are expensive.

249
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:41,200
I shouldn't have told you.
I just didn't want you to be shocked.

250
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,161
I'm already in shock.

251
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:46,747
Hey, get changed first.

252
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,666
No, do something about your hair first.

253
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:01,429
What?

254
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:05,850
Weren't we going to the beach?

255
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,728
We are. That's why I rented these.

256
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:10,521
Let's go.

257
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:17,028
You know that Ki-baek is
on a date with Cho-hui, right?

258
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,031
Yes.

259
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:23,075
You two won that date ticket together.
Aren't you hurt?

260
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:27,538
No. I totally understand.

261
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:28,789
I'm not hurt at all.

262
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:31,125
You're not hurt? Really?

263
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:34,962
After trying so hard to win the game?

264
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,759
I'm just the type to give my best
in everything I do.

265
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:44,513
Our feelings are so unpredictable.

266
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:45,598
You know?

267
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:49,060
But I was quite surprised
by Ki-baek's choice.

268
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,812
When you guys were playing
the game earlier,

269
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,691
the look in his eyes
when he gazed at you was genuine.

270
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:03,241
I guess he wanted
a date with his first love.

271
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:19,590
Ki-baek, we got enough shots
of the scenery,

272
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,467
so just keep this distance.

273
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:25,596
Cho-hui, hold tight.

274
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:27,139
What?

275
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:30,935
What's he doing?

276
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:32,979
- What is he doing?
- Ki-baek!

277
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:34,397
Hey, I-na. Go faster.

278
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:36,399
Seriously?

279
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:39,235
The left foot, left, left!

280
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,168
Why did you do that?

281
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,088
So we could be alone.

282
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,529
Why did you do that?

283
00:21:25,823 --> 00:21:26,782
Do what?

284
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,826
Choi Yu-yeong.

285
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:30,911
<i>You have a boyfriend.</i>

286
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:35,875
What do you mean? Oh, Ki-baek?

287
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,920
The food vlogger, Je I-su.
Isn't he your boyfriend?

288
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,298
I overheard you guys talking on the phone.

289
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,925
No, he's not.

290
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,929
I know a guy who's Je I-su's close friend.

291
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:51,432
He said I-su has a picture of you two
as his phone wallpaper

292
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:53,601
and told him you're his girlfriend.

293
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:55,102
Cho-hui.

294
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:57,438
Please keep it a secret.

295
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:02,777
I can't.

296
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:11,660
What do you want then?

297
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:13,079
Get lost.

298
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,706
Drop out of the show.

299
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:22,296
If you don't, you're screwed.

300
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:25,007
I'll go public with it.

301
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:32,973
You have no right to kick out anyone.

302
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:36,394
You could've resolved it
with the help of the production team.

303
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:39,397
But Yu-yeong lied first.

304
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:41,690
That's wrong, you know.

305
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:45,986
All I did was tell her
what she did was wrong.

306
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:49,490
Ki-baek!

307
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,659
Your mic isn't working.

308
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:59,708
The people making this show,

309
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,335
you may not know this,

310
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:05,339
but they're pouring their hearts
and souls into it.

311
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:07,842
What you did could've destroyed it.

312
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:10,344
Are you bummed that Yu-yeong left?

313
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,054
Because you liked her?

314
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:14,765
No.

315
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:19,145
Don't you have feelings for her?

316
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,188
No, not at all.

317
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,027
So it's not me,
and it isn't Yu-yeong either? Then...

318
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:31,282
The show is all about seeing how you react

319
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:34,577
when faced with your past love
and someone you like now, you know?

320
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:38,622
She's a part of my past,
but she could be someone else's present.

321
00:23:38,622 --> 00:23:40,332
I think it could be interesting.

322
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,130
I made a misjudgment.

323
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:49,466
It was On Woo-ju.

324
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:51,719
Seriously, no more.

325
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,430
Don't do anything.

326
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,935
Hey, sorry.

327
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,021
You must've been confused
at the crossroads.

328
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:04,565
- Thank you.
- That was great.

329
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:05,608
Thank you.

330
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:19,914
I bet you think
I made another selfish move.

331
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,751
I told them we dated in the past,

332
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:26,629
without considering
whether you'd be okay with it.

333
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:34,470
I admit I wanted to spend
more time with you.

334
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:37,723
I saw the situation as my chance.
But more importantly,

335
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:43,562
seeing you running around
like a headless chicken on set at night

336
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:45,606
broke my heart.

337
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:49,318
Even if we broke up because you hated me,

338
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:53,030
and even if it'd make you hate me
even more, I had to do it.

339
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:56,867
So hate me all you want.

340
00:24:57,952 --> 00:24:58,953
I'm sorry.

341
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:05,167
I know why you did it.
And I don't resent you.

342
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:10,130
I have to go.

343
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:25,354
Hello.

344
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,197
Mister, is that good?

345
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:37,408
Nobody eats chicken breast for its taste.

346
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:38,867
Then why do you eat it?

347
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:40,828
To prevent muscle loss.

348
00:25:58,387 --> 00:26:02,016
Mister, this is really nice.

349
00:26:02,766 --> 00:26:04,351
How about we swap?

350
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:07,980
I can't give you this. I need to eat both.
If not, I'll lose my muscle mass.

351
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:12,359
Hey, Un-baek.

352
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,820
Why are you still here? Go home already.

353
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,072
It's not like I'm here to play.

354
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,325
Hello!

355
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:22,036
Hey, kiddo.

356
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:26,540
What are you doing here?
Did you come here alone?

357
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,585
I came with my grandma.
I'm here to see my mom.

358
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:31,045
Your mom, I see.

359
00:26:32,212 --> 00:26:33,130
Wait. Mom?

360
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,508
My mom works for a TV network,
so she's always really busy.

361
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:40,220
Right, you said your mom worked in TV.

362
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:44,683
Then by any chance,
is your grandma a hairstylist?

363
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:45,642
That's right.

364
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,562
You're the landlady's daughter's son?

365
00:26:50,981 --> 00:26:51,815
Hey.

366
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:55,402
By any chance, is your mom's name O--

367
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:56,362
Mom!

368
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:58,197
Gu-won!

369
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:02,409
This is my mom.

370
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:04,411
She's the captain here.

371
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,626
- Hey, Gu-won.
- What's wrong?

372
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:12,461
- What--
- Going around alone is dangerous.

373
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:13,420
Okay?

374
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:16,548
Were you hanging out with them?

375
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:17,466
No.

376
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:22,096
That man kept talking about Ms. Loss.

377
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:23,555
What?

378
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:27,976
But this guy and I are pretty close.

379
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:32,689
Oh, I've seen him a few times
in the neighborhood. That's all.

380
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:35,275
Now I know he's your son.

381
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,406
Thank goodness.

382
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:42,741
Thank goodness, my ass.

383
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:48,747
What's wrong?

384
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:50,999
What?

385
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:54,378
Ms. Loss.

386
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:59,007
All right, let's see.

387
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:05,931
Woo-ju.

388
00:28:13,397 --> 00:28:15,858
This one's pretty.
It'll look great on you.

389
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:18,735
Oh, really? Thank you.

390
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:23,532
Why did you hide that
you're Jeong-heon's ex-girlfriend?

391
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:29,329
Oh, that.

392
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:31,331
I wasn't trying to hide it, per se.

393
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:33,959
I liked you better
as On Woo-ju, the writer.

394
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:36,211
Yu-yeong probably felt the same way.

395
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:39,506
Pardon me?

396
00:28:57,024 --> 00:28:59,401
Yeah, I'm in front
of the meeting hall. Hurry--

397
00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:02,070
Isn't that Kim Jeong-heon?

398
00:29:02,696 --> 00:29:04,490
My goodness. This is crazy.

399
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:08,035
No. I shouldn't embarrass Woo-ju.

400
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:11,205
I must keep my composure. Be graceful.

401
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:14,541
I'm a fan of yours.

402
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:18,962
I'm touched to see you in real life.
I'm touched.

403
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,006
Hello, thank you.

404
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:21,965
Wait.

405
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:24,843
May I get your autograph?

406
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:27,387
Then I'll brag about it
for the rest of my life.

407
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:29,264
Well, ma'am, I'm sorry.

408
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:31,642
He's in the middle of a shoot right now.

409
00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:32,726
Ma'am?

410
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,103
Yes, sure thing.

411
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:36,522
Got a pen?

412
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:39,274
Here.

413
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:42,736
I'd love one right here.

414
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,213
Thank you.

415
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,008
- You go on ahead first.
- What?

416
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:06,760
- Go ahead.
- All right.

417
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:13,600
Well, it's nice to meet you.

418
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,727
- Aren't you--
- Mom.

419
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:18,355
Hey, Woo-ju.

420
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:20,107
This is my daughter.

421
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:22,734
Oh, you two must know each other.

422
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,447
Yes. Can I introduce myself to her?

423
00:30:28,574 --> 00:30:31,577
Mom, come with me.
I think you gave me the wrong suitcase.

424
00:30:31,577 --> 00:30:34,079
Wrong suitcase? What do you mean?

425
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,414
Hey, what's wrong?

426
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:46,174
<i>How do you feel
now that you've met her again?</i>

427
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:48,176
{\an8}It's hard to explain.

428
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:49,928
{\an8}She's lovely.

429
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:51,096
{\an8}She makes me so happy.

430
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:52,222
{\an8}She lit up my heart.

431
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:55,559
{\an8}A lot of time has passed
but she hasn't changed one bit.

432
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,396
{\an8}People don't change easily.
It's situations that change.

433
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:01,273
{\an8}I hate that word itself.

434
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:02,983
{\an8}Ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.

435
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:06,153
{\an8}Ex, ex-something. I think it's so lame.

436
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:09,990
{\an8}I don't care if she's his first love.
It was before we met, so who cares?

437
00:31:10,574 --> 00:31:13,035
{\an8}But why did they break up?

438
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:16,580
<i>I'm more curious about stuff like that
than how couples met.</i>

439
00:31:17,497 --> 00:31:19,499
The basic rules are the same as Jenga.

440
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:22,669
Each player will remove a block
and ask the question written on it.

441
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,588
I see, we'll play Drunk Jenga.

442
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:27,341
So is this like
the Jenga version of Truth or Dare?

443
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:30,928
It's game over once the tower falls.
The one who made it fall must drink.

444
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:32,888
Same thing if you don't want to answer.

445
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:33,847
All right, then.

446
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:38,352
Is Woo-ju still getting ready?

447
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:19,017
She should've told us
she was going to dress up.

448
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:22,604
- Should I take this off?
- You barely have any clothes on as it is.

449
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:35,242
{\an8}My turn.

450
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:42,791
For this one...

451
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:47,254
I should ask someone who's honest.

452
00:32:49,256 --> 00:32:50,340
FIRST IMPRESSION

453
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,592
Tell us your first impression
of all the girls.

454
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,599
First off, you, Hae-ri.
I thought you looked like a meerkat.

455
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:04,688
You were extending your neck so you could
look around and check out the others,

456
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:07,733
like a little spy. I thought it was cute.

457
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:09,860
That's so true.

458
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,278
And as for you, Hui-seon...

459
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:16,575
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

460
00:33:17,826 --> 00:33:19,453
That's fine. I understand.

461
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,913
And Cho-hui was...

462
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,418
She was pretty.

463
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:30,797
We met in the broadcasting room
in the early spring,

464
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:32,799
and she was wearing a duffel coat.

465
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:36,845
She was laughing at Jeong-heon's joke.

466
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:45,437
As for Ms. On...

467
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:51,610
Poop?

468
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:56,615
Poop?

469
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,158
What kind of poop?

470
00:33:58,158 --> 00:34:00,285
I think I'm better than poop.

471
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:01,661
Right? Me too.

472
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:06,750
Perhaps, that day changed my life.

473
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:17,594
Woo-ju.

474
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:20,347
Do memories have power?

475
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:25,644
Memories? No, they don't.

476
00:34:27,854 --> 00:34:28,730
But

477
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:32,901
the experiences you gain
while building those memories do.

478
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:36,488
It means you know
that much about the person.

479
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:53,713
Who will you go out with tomorrow?

480
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:56,383
Me?

481
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:58,635
I haven't decided yet.

482
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:01,555
Then can I make a pitch?

483
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:07,686
Someone's popular!

484
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:13,483
I totally sensed the tension just now.
What's going on here?

485
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:14,943
A love triangle?

486
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:21,158
Interesting. Hey, Seong-jun.

487
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:23,410
Who's the prettiest here?

488
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:27,455
This is Truth or Dare,
so I can only tell the truth, right?

489
00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:29,082
Pass.

490
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,585
Next.

491
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:33,837
Louis, make up your mind right now.

492
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:36,173
Cho-hui is not interested in you at all.

493
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,968
It's so hard.
I can't figure out what my heart wants.

494
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,888
What is this, supply without demand?

495
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:53,398
We can ask anything we want
if we get the X block, right?

496
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,501
Why did you and Woo-ju break up?

497
00:36:22,385 --> 00:36:23,553
Well...

498
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:33,480
Because of my broken microwave.

499
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:39,444
This broke again.

500
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:44,157
Man. Hey, Woo-ju.

501
00:36:44,157 --> 00:36:46,368
It'll just be a moment, all right?

502
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:47,535
Just a moment.

503
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:57,337
All right.

504
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:58,922
That worked.

505
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:01,758
Oh, man. I'm starving.

506
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,262
Why aren't you eating?

507
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:12,269
I'm convinced there's something wrong
with Ms. Bok-ja's knowledge about kimchi.

508
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:14,104
She's getting more creative, but this...

509
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:17,899
This batch is... My goodness.

510
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:20,360
Why did you lie?

511
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,113
She made it for me.
Of course I should say it's good.

512
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:24,948
Because you always lie,

513
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:28,868
my mom makes kimchi
when she doesn't even know how to do it.

514
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:31,705
If it's not good, just say so. Why lie?

515
00:37:31,705 --> 00:37:34,457
No, I didn't lie.
You know I was just joking.

516
00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:36,543
It's good. It really is.

517
00:37:38,378 --> 00:37:39,504
It really is good.

518
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:46,094
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to eat.

519
00:37:46,928 --> 00:37:48,471
Is it because of the microwave?

520
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:50,390
I'll get it fixed.

521
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:53,768
I'll buy a new one
when I get paid this month.

522
00:37:55,729 --> 00:37:58,189
It was a used microwave
and you've had it long enough.

523
00:37:58,189 --> 00:38:01,026
Why bother getting it fixed?
Just throw it out.

524
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:08,033
Hey, Woo-ju.
I'm not sure why you're so upset,

525
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:10,160
but can you please try to snap out of it?

526
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:14,205
Come on,
it's our third anniversary today.

527
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:16,458
Did I embarrass you?

528
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:18,501
What?

529
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:21,921
The woman from a family of teachers
who works at a broadcasting station.

530
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:24,215
Who is she? It's not me.

531
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:27,427
Was my mom here?

532
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:33,516
Hey, let's talk.

533
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:36,061
You're just like the others. No.

534
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:37,937
You're the worst.

535
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:40,273
You should've never acted like
you understood

536
00:38:40,273 --> 00:38:42,442
and just pitied us like everyone else!

537
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:43,610
Hear me out. I--

538
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,906
You denied me and my mom.
That is what you did.

539
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:50,742
Did you think she'd never find out
that it was a lie?

540
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:53,078
Or were you hoping
I'd play along and lie too?

541
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:55,872
Hey, all is fine
if our relationship is solid.

542
00:38:55,872 --> 00:39:00,335
This way, we don't have to worry about
what others might think.

543
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:03,296
- Woo-ju, please--
- Don't touch me!

544
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:11,721
<i>Because my microwave broke.</i>

545
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:16,393
Your microwave broke?

546
00:39:16,393 --> 00:39:17,310
And?

547
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,686
You couldn't get it fixed?

548
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:21,231
An A-list celebrity's
heartbreaking love story

549
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:23,149
from the time when no one knew him?

550
00:39:24,317 --> 00:39:28,321
I was beyond embarrassed

551
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:33,284
because I did something
so horribly stupid.

552
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:36,663
I'll just leave it at that.

553
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:38,832
I'll drink this.

554
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:50,927
Hey, I got a text.

555
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:52,846
Oh, what does it say?

556
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,980
COUPLE'S PARADISE

557
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,860
{\an8}MESSAGE THE PERSON YOU WANT
TO GO ON A DATE WITH TOMORROW

558
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:40,310
- Min-gu.
- Yes, ma'am.

559
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,897
The newbies shouldn't carry
more than two boxes at a time.

560
00:40:43,897 --> 00:40:47,025
I told you it was dangerous.
You can't see what's ahead of you.

561
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:50,987
Captain.

562
00:40:53,406 --> 00:40:56,451
Be careful.
You're not here to flex your muscles.

563
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:00,747
Mom!

564
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,542
- What did you do?
- He's all grown up.

565
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,044
- Me? I was observing.
- What?

566
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:07,253
That's her son.

567
00:41:07,253 --> 00:41:08,254
I know.

568
00:41:08,254 --> 00:41:11,758
I thought Captain was single.

569
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:13,218
She is single.

570
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,094
A single mother.

571
00:41:16,054 --> 00:41:18,056
- Conches.
- Yeah.

572
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:20,058
- And clams.
- Clams.

573
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:22,977
- Over there.
- The beach over there?

574
00:41:22,977 --> 00:41:24,229
- Yeah.
- Wait!

575
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,567
Can I call you when we're back in Seoul?

576
00:41:31,861 --> 00:41:32,695
Sure.

577
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:38,159
Then, can I get your number?

578
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:40,203
You already have it.

579
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:41,663
Check the crew directory.

580
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:43,373
The crew directory?

581
00:41:48,545 --> 00:41:50,463
- Come on, Mom.
- 593359...

582
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:53,466
It was in the directory.

583
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,009
Yes!

584
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,526
{\an8}HEAVEN HOUSE

585
00:42:40,847 --> 00:42:43,224
I'm surprised you chose me.

586
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,102
What do you want to do?

587
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:52,025
He's handsome. You're so hot!

588
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:05,371
What are we here to do?

589
00:43:10,376 --> 00:43:11,377
First,

590
00:43:12,211 --> 00:43:13,755
let's get you a pair of shoes.

591
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:24,098
My goodness, Jeong-heon. Hello.

592
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:26,225
- Hello.
- Come on in.

593
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,230
This red one's nice.

594
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:44,410
Come on...

595
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:47,914
I can do it myself.

596
00:43:47,914 --> 00:43:49,165
No.

597
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:02,345
Woo-ju.

598
00:44:06,808 --> 00:44:07,809
Wait, this is...

599
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:11,813
You want to go pick up trash?

600
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:14,565
Yeah. Let's go.

601
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:25,034
I got no sleep the night before I came
because I was up all night baking this.

602
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,336
Ki-baek...

603
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:41,509
I know how you feel.

604
00:44:53,604 --> 00:44:55,398
Oh, man. Aren't you getting tired?

605
00:44:55,398 --> 00:44:57,525
No, it relaxing. It helps me not think.

606
00:44:57,525 --> 00:44:58,693
That's good.

607
00:45:00,278 --> 00:45:02,739
Are you sure
this is all you want to do?

608
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:07,118
Keep picking them up. Don't slack off.

609
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:08,661
Hon, you'd better--

610
00:45:10,496 --> 00:45:12,415
You'd better not slack off, Mr. Kim.

611
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:15,960
THIS WAY TO THE BEACH

612
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,378
We're almost there.

613
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:22,842
<i>I hope</i>

614
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:25,970
you'll choose me.

615
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:30,308
- You said you know how I feel.
- Exactly.

616
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:32,643
That's why I'm telling you this.

617
00:45:34,187 --> 00:45:37,732
The others don't know me well, but you do.

618
00:45:41,861 --> 00:45:43,029
You said

619
00:45:44,197 --> 00:45:48,451
the people making this show were
pouring their hearts and souls into it.

620
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:50,661
So am I.

621
00:45:52,622 --> 00:45:53,539
And so is Ms. On.

622
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,375
We all are.

623
00:45:57,585 --> 00:45:58,461
Cho-hui.

624
00:45:58,461 --> 00:45:59,629
Help me.

625
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:03,174
No, please like me back, Ki-baek.

626
00:46:05,301 --> 00:46:07,220
Before I ruin myself further.

627
00:46:15,728 --> 00:46:16,729
We're here.

628
00:46:25,655 --> 00:46:27,532
THROW YOUR TRASH HERE

629
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:43,005
Shall we sit down?

630
00:46:44,924 --> 00:46:45,758
Sure.

631
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,723
Know what that boulder is called?

632
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,644
Trash Boulder.

633
00:46:58,396 --> 00:47:01,941
A long time ago, when the people
on this island didn't farm at all

634
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:04,360
and fished to survive,

635
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,195
there were many widows living here.

636
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:12,201
Their husbands probably went to sea
to catch fish and never came back.

637
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:18,332
The widows would be
stuck at home, crying all day.

638
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:20,251
Then grannies would come and say,

639
00:47:21,377 --> 00:47:24,589
"Go out and pick up trash,
or you'll fall ill at this rate."

640
00:47:25,464 --> 00:47:29,510
Then one of the widows picked up
a basket and started picking up trash.

641
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:32,805
She was devastated and couldn't sleep,
so she thought she should

642
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:34,974
just get out of the house
and do something.

643
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:41,147
Then one by one,
more widows started to join her.

644
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:44,025
They'd each pick up
a basket full of trash,

645
00:47:44,984 --> 00:47:50,072
then leave the baskets under the boulder
and cry together for a while.

646
00:47:50,906 --> 00:47:52,366
Hence the name, Trash Boulder.

647
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:56,412
It's where you get rid of things
you want to forget.

648
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,084
Woo-ju...

649
00:48:05,671 --> 00:48:07,965
I hope you can leave it all behind,
right here.

650
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:14,388
The old me

651
00:48:15,598 --> 00:48:17,516
and the old us.

652
00:48:32,448 --> 00:48:33,658
<i>You said</i>

653
00:48:34,575 --> 00:48:38,746
the people making this show were
pouring their hearts and souls into it.

654
00:48:40,373 --> 00:48:41,290
Don't worry.

655
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,709
<i>Ms. On is one of them.</i>

656
00:48:45,836 --> 00:48:47,797
If you don't choose me,

657
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:50,633
I will destroy everything.
On Woo-ju and this show.

658
00:48:52,426 --> 00:48:54,595
There's a lot
I want to get out of this.

659
00:49:02,478 --> 00:49:04,939
Ki-baek, get ready to
make your final choice.

660
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:20,454
<i>One moment.</i>

661
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:26,335
Protect your heart. You're the only one
here who can protect yourself.

662
00:49:26,335 --> 00:49:28,003
<i>It was cool.</i>

663
00:49:28,003 --> 00:49:30,423
It was cool how you left.
I've never seen anything like it.

664
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:32,717
<i>Let's give it a shot, this dating...</i>

665
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:33,634
show.

666
00:49:33,634 --> 00:49:36,887
<i>I'm sure viewers will love the real you.</i>

667
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,640
My heart fluttered.

668
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,768
And right now, my heart is fluttering.

669
00:49:46,731 --> 00:49:47,732
That's pretty.

670
00:50:59,428 --> 00:51:01,597
Did something happen? What's up?

671
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:04,433
I like you.

672
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:05,893
What?

673
00:51:05,893 --> 00:51:07,353
I like you, Ms. On Woo-ju.

674
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:13,609
After that incident,

675
00:51:15,027 --> 00:51:18,614
I felt like losing the ability to lie
was like a punishment,

676
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,283
but when I spent time with you, I realized

677
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:27,081
maybe it's the only thing giving me hope
that I can change my life.

678
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:28,415
I really thought that.

679
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:32,461
It was nice, and it made me happy.

680
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,551
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

681
00:51:38,551 --> 00:51:41,136
Sometimes I felt like
I was riding a roller coaster,

682
00:51:41,136 --> 00:51:45,891
but whenever I felt like that,
you became my safety bar.

683
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:50,312
And thanks to you,
I'm still here, alive and well.

684
00:51:52,231 --> 00:51:55,442
Ki-baek, you're emotional right now.
You need to calm down--

685
00:51:55,442 --> 00:51:57,486
I want to protect you too, On Woo-ju.

686
00:52:00,364 --> 00:52:01,866
Although I'm not sure if I can.

687
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:24,513
You can say I let you down.

688
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:28,434
I've got nothing to say
even if you call me a coward.

689
00:52:29,476 --> 00:52:30,644
But right now...

690
00:52:32,688 --> 00:52:33,814
I must do this.

691
00:52:38,444 --> 00:52:39,403
I'm sorry.

692
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:48,829
<i>You will now make your final choices.</i>

693
00:53:26,158 --> 00:53:26,992
Ki-baek,

694
00:53:28,577 --> 00:53:30,829
please make your final choice.

695
00:54:02,486 --> 00:54:07,157
Ki-baek chose Cho-hui.

696
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:18,085
Woo-ju, please make your final choice.

697
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:45,529
{\an8}A MONTH LATER

698
00:54:46,947 --> 00:54:48,073
Auntie!

699
00:54:48,073 --> 00:54:50,242
My goodness.

700
00:54:50,242 --> 00:54:52,703
How come I haven't seen you in so long?

701
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:55,372
Come on. You see me every day on TV.

702
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:57,416
It's been so long. Come on in.

703
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:58,333
All right.

704
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:01,879
Whenever you're on TV, I feel proud
as if my own son has become a star.

705
00:55:01,879 --> 00:55:03,130
- Really?
- Yes, really.

706
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,550
Well, then let your superstar son
boost your sales today.

707
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:10,721
So, how many people are coming?
You rented the entire restaurant.

708
00:55:13,182 --> 00:55:14,016
Just two.

709
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,336
Will Ki-baek become
a superstar after this? Cool.

710
00:55:42,336 --> 00:55:44,505
I should get him on my YouTube channel.

711
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:47,633
You're always trying to ride
on someone else's coattails

712
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:49,301
instead of living your own life.

713
00:55:49,301 --> 00:55:50,677
Look who's talking.

714
00:55:50,677 --> 00:55:52,679
I know he gave you a nice allowance.

715
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:55,557
Oh. The gym went bankrupt,
so you should work as his manager.

716
00:55:55,557 --> 00:55:58,435
Hey, do you think
I stayed there to make money?

717
00:55:58,435 --> 00:56:00,771
That wasn't the reason? Then why?

718
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:03,482
You went there on an errand,
so why did you stay for days?

719
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:07,611
Are you two going to keep bickering?
You aren't kids anymore.

720
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:08,987
He started it, not me.

721
00:56:08,987 --> 00:56:10,697
He ignored and belittled me first.

722
00:56:11,365 --> 00:56:13,200
Shut it. He always has to provoke me.

723
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,576
Be quiet, both of you.

724
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:16,078
I'm here.

725
00:56:16,078 --> 00:56:17,204
It's been a while.

726
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:18,580
Yes, hello.

727
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,873
You must be hungry.

728
00:56:23,418 --> 00:56:24,253
It's Ki-baek!

729
00:56:25,045 --> 00:56:26,922
It's starting. The show's starting.

730
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:28,799
Your daughter is really in the show too?

731
00:56:30,175 --> 00:56:32,970
From the next episode.
You won't see her in this episode.

732
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,431
She's the heroine appearing
at the most critical moment?

733
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:37,474
She's a writer,

734
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:40,811
but she appears in TV shows?
She must be really talented.

735
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:43,897
I won't give away any spoilers.
Watch. Stay tuned.

736
00:56:55,409 --> 00:56:57,119
<i>I'm late, aren't I? Sorry.</i>

737
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,376
The traffic was so bad.

738
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:06,795
What are you, the woman of the hour?

739
00:57:06,795 --> 00:57:07,713
- Have a seat.
- Hi.

740
00:57:07,713 --> 00:57:10,007
- Hey, what's up? Eat.
- Hello.

741
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:11,216
You must be hungry.

742
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:21,143
What's up, you two?
Why are you so awkward?

743
00:57:21,977 --> 00:57:23,687
You sure you're in the same show?

744
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:27,024
Hey, enough talking. Just eat.

745
00:57:27,024 --> 00:57:28,942
Why? They're so awkward.

746
00:57:30,986 --> 00:57:32,112
Why are they awkward?

747
00:57:33,155 --> 00:57:34,656
- Thanks for the food!
- Thank you!

748
00:57:34,656 --> 00:57:36,575
Eat up. We can order more food.

749
00:57:36,575 --> 00:57:39,912
Excuse me, we'll take the "Heon" soju!

750
00:57:39,912 --> 00:57:41,330
- Nice one!
- Soju is a must.

751
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:42,998
The show's starting.

752
00:57:42,998 --> 00:57:45,751
Didn't you say
you couldn't have dinner with me today?

753
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:48,337
My plans got canceled.

754
00:57:49,087 --> 00:57:50,714
How did you find this place?

755
00:57:50,714 --> 00:57:54,051
And stir-fried longarm octopus?
You can't handle spicy food.

756
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:57,596
WOO-JU
SORRY, I'VE GOT PLANS

757
00:57:57,596 --> 00:57:58,639
Hey, it's good.

758
00:58:00,766 --> 00:58:01,600
Just eat, okay?

759
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:05,187
What?

760
00:58:05,187 --> 00:58:07,105
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers!

761
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,657
{\an8}- Push him.
- No, Ki-baek.

762
00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:20,369
{\an8}You'd better not lose. What are you doing?

763
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:22,496
Mom, I lose in the end. I lose.

764
00:58:22,496 --> 00:58:23,622
I lost this match.

765
00:58:24,206 --> 00:58:25,290
- Ki-baek.
- What?

766
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,960
We're enjoying the show.
Don't give away any spoilers.

767
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,086
That's a big no-no!

768
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:31,171
- For God's sake.
- Hey!

769
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:34,091
<i>Oh, no! Get up.</i>

770
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:35,968
<i>Whoa.</i>

771
00:58:45,018 --> 00:58:47,479
That was very cool. Ki-baek, you rock.

772
00:58:47,479 --> 00:58:49,356
Do you and that girl become a couple?

773
00:58:49,356 --> 00:58:50,315
What?

774
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,570
These days, people participate
in shows like this

775
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,655
and get married, you know?

776
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:59,199
You'll wake up tomorrow
with a grandchild in your arms.

777
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:01,243
Did you get her pregnant?

778
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:04,037
All right, let's tidy up
and go downstairs.

779
00:59:04,037 --> 00:59:05,497
- Let's tidy up.
- Yes, sir.

780
00:59:05,497 --> 00:59:06,873
All righty.

781
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm so full.

782
00:59:11,837 --> 00:59:13,213
- Oh, boy.
- I'm really full.

783
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:15,090
This is so heavy.

784
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:19,720
Tell me later. Okay?

785
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:31,356
It's been a while.

786
00:59:32,274 --> 00:59:33,108
Pardon me?

787
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,069
It's nothing.

788
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:19,154
Shoot.

789
01:00:21,448 --> 01:00:24,117
I came here
so you could stay on the rooftop.

790
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,328
Right.

791
01:00:29,164 --> 01:00:31,583
Are you really avoiding me? Why?

792
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:33,794
Avoiding you? Who? Me?

793
01:00:33,794 --> 01:00:36,880
It was just awkward, you know.

794
01:00:37,756 --> 01:00:39,466
And I felt bad.

795
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:44,137
Has it been a month since I last saw you?

796
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:48,433
You seemed really busy.
Going to work early and coming home late.

797
01:00:49,518 --> 01:00:51,978
What? So you've been watching me.

798
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,068
So are you back on the writing team?

799
01:00:58,652 --> 01:01:03,615
Oh, I'm not involved in the pilot at all,
but it could get a regular slot.

800
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:07,411
- So I prepared some things just in case.
- I see.

801
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,831
What about you? Have you been well?

802
01:01:11,748 --> 01:01:12,582
Nope.

803
01:01:14,126 --> 01:01:14,960
Right.

804
01:01:15,752 --> 01:01:17,921
It's impossible not to sneeze
for a whole month.

805
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:24,594
But even so,
how could you not call me once?

806
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:26,972
I saw you every day.

807
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:36,857
This is our first time talking
since that day.

808
01:01:45,323 --> 01:01:48,076
You should've told me!
I can't believe you didn't tell me!

809
01:01:52,497 --> 01:01:54,040
You must've been stressed out.

810
01:01:56,084 --> 01:01:57,919
Why didn't you tell me?

811
01:01:57,919 --> 01:02:00,505
Well, I regretted my decision.

812
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:02,883
And I felt bad.

813
01:02:03,592 --> 01:02:05,343
I didn't mean to keep it from you,

814
01:02:05,343 --> 01:02:07,721
but I didn't realize
so much time had passed.

815
01:02:07,721 --> 01:02:10,182
I didn't know
and was on an emotional roller coaster.

816
01:02:10,182 --> 01:02:12,309
One day, I'd think you were a weirdo.

817
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:14,227
Then I'd get curious about you.

818
01:02:14,227 --> 01:02:15,896
And on some days, I missed you.

819
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:21,943
You missed me?

820
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:24,446
Oh, I...

821
01:02:27,699 --> 01:02:28,909
I missed you too.

822
01:02:29,534 --> 01:02:30,786
You said you saw me every day.

823
01:02:31,411 --> 01:02:32,954
I wanted to really see you.

824
01:02:48,512 --> 01:02:50,472
I'm curious about something too.

825
01:02:52,516 --> 01:02:53,350
What?

826
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:55,560
Three seconds.

827
01:02:56,645 --> 01:02:59,481
What did you think about
when you were making your final choice?

828
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,287
<i>If you feel nervous
in front of the camera,</i>

829
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:16,164
<i>close your eyes, and for three seconds,</i>

830
01:03:16,957 --> 01:03:19,960
think of what made you happiest recently.

831
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,101
That's pretty.

832
01:03:37,185 --> 01:03:39,229
Yeah, pretty.

833
01:03:47,404 --> 01:03:49,739
I will not choose anyone.

834
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,291
Yeah, pretty.

{\an8}<i>Are you guys in a relationship?</i>

839
01:05:33,343 --> 01:05:34,594
{\an8}<i>I'm not sure.</i>

840
01:05:34,594 --> 01:05:37,555
{\an8}<i>Uncertainty between a man
and a woman can be bad.</i>

841
01:05:37,555 --> 01:05:39,432
{\an8}She never texts me first.

842
01:05:39,432 --> 01:05:41,434
{\an8}Are you dating someone, Woo-ju?

843
01:05:41,434 --> 01:05:44,437
{\an8}You look so much better than
the last time I saw you.

844
01:05:44,437 --> 01:05:47,065
{\an8}<i>Did you start to secretly date Jeong-heon?</i>

845
01:05:47,065 --> 01:05:49,359
{\an8}<i>I guess everything will
come up roses for you now.</i>

846
01:05:49,943 --> 01:05:51,027
{\an8}Come on!

847
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:52,654
{\an8}Perhaps I should throw it away.

848
01:05:52,654 --> 01:05:54,990
{\an8}Cut! We're not doing this.

849
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:56,282
{\an8}I like On Woo-ju.

850
01:05:57,075 --> 01:05:58,201
{\an8}Is she busy?

851
01:05:58,201 --> 01:05:59,160
{\an8}<i>Don't be sorry.</i>

852
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,537
{\an8}<i>I really do understand.</i>
