FRANKLY SPEAKING 💞 @ kissasian.one

2
00:01:04,553 --> 00:01:05,596
You know, I'm hurt.

3
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:11,101
I mean, I get it.

4
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,396
But you, Ms. On, you really hurt me.

5
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:17,566
But you know what?

6
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:20,652
I can't quite figure out why I'm hurt.

7
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:28,118
What was the potential you saw in me?

8
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,954
What was it that you saw in me?

9
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,251
My heart fluttered.

10
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:40,839
<i>She basically confessed her feelings.</i>

11
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:48,263
How did that make you feel?

12
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:51,975
I...

13
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:53,977
And right now...

14
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:58,607
My heart is fluttering.

15
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:07,574
When people are anxious
due to a rush of adrenaline,

16
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,910
they often act and speak impulsively.

17
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:12,788
<i>But those feelings</i>

18
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,958
<i>are only true for a moment.</i>

19
00:02:17,793 --> 00:02:21,255
Even if it's just for a moment,
they're still real feelings.

20
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:25,509
<i>Don't say anything.</i>

21
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:30,764
I'm sorry, Ki-baek. I made a mistake.

22
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:42,109
You got lost in the woods,

23
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:44,653
and Yu-yeong hugged you
the moment you showed up.

24
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,530
That's proof her feelings are genuine.

25
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,701
By the way,

26
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:52,995
why do you keep smiling?

27
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:03,130
EPISODE 6 💞 @ kissasian.one

28
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,569
{\an8}Oh, Jeong-heon, look.

29
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,618
Hey, Woo-ju. Are you all right?

30
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:35,871
I'm fine.

31
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,917
Ki-baek!

32
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:45,172
You're not hurt, are you?

33
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,382
I was worried sick.

34
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,471
- On Woo-ju.
- Hey.

35
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:55,015
- What happened to your leg?
- I twisted my ankle.

36
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,017
Why did you storm off like that?

37
00:03:58,769 --> 00:03:59,937
Get this on camera.

38
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,940
But we'll have to cut out
the whole horror game.

39
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,985
She's confessing. It's a great scene.
We should film it even if we can't use it.

40
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,032
What is it?

41
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,285
You're alive, so it's all good.

42
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,454
- Woo-ju!
- Woo-ju!

43
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:18,956
- Woo-ju.
- Are you okay?

44
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:20,040
Yeah, I'm fine.

45
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:22,834
- I'm sorry. I should've gone with you.
- I'm okay.

46
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,211
- I'm fine.
- Are you hurt?

47
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:26,046
I'm sorry I worried you guys.

48
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,006
I'm really okay. Let's head down.

49
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,258
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

50
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:30,467
You must be tired.

51
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,427
- I'll carry you.
- No, stop it. I'm good.

52
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:33,512
Oh, okay.

53
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,183
- Come on.
- Let's go.

54
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:40,936
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

55
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,525
{\an8}HEAVEN HOUSE

56
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,203
So you tumbled down the hill.

57
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,205
Yes.

58
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:02,541
That was a close call.

59
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:04,710
Yes.

60
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:08,964
Woo-ju gets easily scared.

61
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:10,716
Yes.

62
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,344
Thanks for coming back safely.

63
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,810
She was like that before too.

64
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:25,314
She didn't like to be alone in the dark.

65
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:31,611
I'm going to go and get some fresh air.

66
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:32,696
Good night.

67
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:48,628
That was childish as hell.

68
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:40,055
Happy birthday.

69
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:42,307
Happy-- Happy birthday.

70
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:48,313
{\an8}KIM JEONG-HEON - SONG KI-BAEK

71
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:54,694
Man, why did it have to...

72
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,789
KI-BAEK

73
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:12,420
No.

74
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,506
Of course not.

75
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:22,556
You scared me.

76
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:24,975
Well, I couldn't sleep.

77
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:26,059
Here.

78
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,530
So you're okay?

79
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,323
You seemed uncomfortable earlier.

80
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:43,743
- Try doing this with your ankle.
- I'm really okay. Totally fine.

81
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:48,039
Right.

82
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:06,975
I wish I hadn't dated you back then.

83
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:11,688
If I dated you now,
I'd be a cooler boyfriend.

84
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:15,108
I was a loser when I was with you,
you know.

85
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,902
Now, I'm totally--

86
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,445
I'm like--

87
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:20,489
They call me
the ideal son-in-law, you know.

88
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:25,368
- Did you just laugh?
- Yeah, I did.

89
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:47,432
Hey, you're still up.

90
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:00,403
I wonder if we could play
a game with this.

91
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:01,488
Let's see.

92
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:10,038
Is this going to be too hard?

93
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,875
What are you doing?

94
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,794
I just got an idea.

95
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:16,878
You can go ahead.

96
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:20,966
Don't stay out too late.

97
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,650
Breakfast in Heaven.

98
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,029
Make breakfast for the person
on your mind right now.

99
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,032
All the pairs who choose each other
will have a breakfast date

100
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:50,036
and get the last hint on
what the guys have in common.

101
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:51,955
Can I order delivery?

102
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:53,373
What do you think?

103
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:59,379
- What?
- We've got a professional chef here.

104
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,506
Isn't it a little unfair?

105
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:03,466
This is not a cooking show.

106
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,636
All that matters is that your food
comes from the heart. Don't worry.

107
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:08,430
What should I make?

108
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,682
- What will you make?
- I don't know about this.

109
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:14,269
- But I can't cook.
- Can I just use a meal kit or something?

110
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,313
Well, this is going to be fun.

111
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:23,612
- I didn't think I'd be cooking here.
- You should only use one hand.

112
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,542
Are you carving it?

113
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:43,590
It looks good.

114
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,682
Okay, good.

115
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:01,983
Don't be so nervous.

116
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:05,445
This isn't about cooking.
It's about dating.

117
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:08,365
Just think about the person
you're cooking for. Nothing else.

118
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,158
The person I'm cooking for.

119
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,871
What kind of food do you like, Ha-young?

120
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,915
What? Why would you ask what I like?

121
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:21,252
You know, there might be some food
that you crave when you're tired at work.

122
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:22,754
I never have an appetite at work.

123
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,298
Even when you see all this food?

124
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,967
Eating props brings
three years of bad luck.

125
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:33,807
I see. You're cranky
because you're hungry.

126
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,225
I'm not cranky.

127
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,685
I'm trying to stay on my toes
because Woo-ju is soft,

128
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,771
and she always goes so easy on people.

129
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:47,695
It looks like you.

130
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:49,489
Here.

131
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:50,573
It looks like you.

132
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:53,535
They're not props.

133
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:58,498
Thanks.

134
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:02,460
Anyway, just try your best.

135
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:42,834
Why did he put a trotter in the middle?

136
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,669
It's like he buried it in a grave.

137
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,380
I've never seen plating like it.

138
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,308
Would you like to have breakfast with me?

139
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,102
Yes, I'd love to.

140
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:09,319
Would you like to join me?

141
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:12,655
Come on.

142
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,668
<i>Would you like to have breakfast with me?</i>

143
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:42,769
Yes.

144
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:44,145
What?

145
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:46,856
I'd love to.

146
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,698
Ki-baek isn't exactly my type,
to be honest.

147
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,201
Sorry?

148
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:01,079
I don't know if it's because
he's honest or just insensitive,

149
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,958
but he's the type to embarrass people
with his words, which is the worst.

150
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:08,878
Then why...

151
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:12,549
It looked like things were going well
between you and Jeong-heon,

152
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:15,051
so why did you have breakfast
with Ki-baek today?

153
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:19,430
Because sometimes
I can see that he's being genuine.

154
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:27,814
<i>And somehow,
the things he does do it for me.</i>

155
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:28,898
Oh, my God!

156
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:32,694
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
That's mean.

157
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:34,988
It must've been caught on camera.

158
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:37,282
Here.

159
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:42,579
Those are fixed cameras,
so they probably didn't catch it.

160
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,289
It's just some gunk.

161
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:45,915
Remove it now.

162
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,001
<i>There's nothing cool about him,</i>

163
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:50,503
but he's different from the others.

164
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:53,464
You're right.

165
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,180
Here.

166
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:06,936
This is amazing.

167
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:07,896
You like it?

168
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,691
Ki-baek?

169
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:13,902
Yes.

170
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:15,111
Aren't you going to eat?

171
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:20,033
I'm happy to just see you enjoying it.

172
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:24,329
It's delicious.

173
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:31,419
You're right.

174
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:34,297
Help yourself.

175
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:42,805
This is the hint?

176
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,057
What does it mean?

177
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,604
Oh, there's another hint
they only gave to the girls yesterday.

178
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,564
I'll tell you.

179
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:56,653
Suzy.

180
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:15,380
<i>Someone got the right answer.</i>

181
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,717
So what's the answer?

182
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,928
She said someone got it
but not what it is.

183
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:23,972
Are we supposed to
just stand here like this?

184
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:31,729
What?

185
00:16:32,313 --> 00:16:33,314
What?

186
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:35,942
No way.

187
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,209
You're kidding.

188
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:36,002
- One of them mentioned her.
- Right?

189
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:40,715
What's going on? Who is she?

190
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,927
My first love.

191
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,141
<i>Cho-hui.</i>

192
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,354
Cho-hui.

193
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:25,301
<i>We first met like it was</i>

194
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:29,138
<i>A coincidental joke
And we talked</i>

195
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:31,766
<i>Your words captured...</i>

196
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:36,771
Happy birthday.

197
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,648
Happy-- Happy birthday.

198
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:42,944
Whoa.

199
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,821
Thank you.

200
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:48,032
It's so pretty.

201
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:54,247
Everyone, please welcome Ms. Min Cho-hui,

202
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,415
the first love of all
our male contestants.

203
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:59,377
With your love stories from the past
and present in the mix,

204
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:01,295
which path will your heart follow?

205
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,342
<i>Couple's Paradise, the First Love</i>.
The second chapter begins now.

206
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:12,348
Hello, I'm Min Cho-hui.

207
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:38,666
Bringing their first love as the new girl
seems a bit unfair.

208
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:42,128
Guys get a little sentimental when
it comes to their first love, you know.

209
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:45,256
Still, it's all in the past.

210
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:47,800
Nothing is different
except she's gotten old.

211
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,180
What's important is the present.

212
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,684
I said whoever guesses what the guys
have in common will be given an advantage.

213
00:19:56,684 --> 00:20:01,439
The advantage is to have
the first date with your first love.

214
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,191
And the winner of the date is...

215
00:20:05,276 --> 00:20:08,029
I shouldn't have told him about Suzy.

216
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:10,156
This sucks.

217
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:17,955
First love?

218
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,711
Someone got the right answer.

219
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:25,671
All right, let's take a short break.

220
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:29,759
After the break, Jeong-heon and Cho-hui
will have their special date.

221
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,844
- Okay, thank you.
- Help me move this!

222
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:40,561
Hey, Cho-hui.

223
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:43,522
I never saw this coming.

224
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,942
I never thought I'd see you here.

225
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:46,859
Right?

226
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:50,571
Do you remember that bar
we used to hang out at near our school?

227
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:52,698
I went there just last week.

228
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:55,785
The scribbles we left
on the wall are still there.

229
00:20:55,785 --> 00:21:00,456
Wait, didn't you say you don't drink beer?
You insisted on having whiskey last night.

230
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:04,543
Now I know why I wanted to make
braised mussels this morning.

231
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,003
Cho-hui, do you remember?

232
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:08,631
You said it always helped
when you caught a cold.

233
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:13,636
So did you know about this whole setup?

234
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:16,138
Yes.

235
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,766
I think it's really cool.

236
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:21,978
Someone as timid as me
would never have the nerve to do this.

237
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:24,188
You must be really open-minded.

238
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,565
Oh, did she used to live abroad?

239
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,566
Yes, with me.

240
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,117
I'm going to go use the bathroom.

241
00:21:36,117 --> 00:21:37,201
Right.

242
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:40,663
The bathroom is this way.
I can show you the way.

243
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,540
No, I can find it on my own.

244
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,090
Cho-hui.

245
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:52,675
Hey.

246
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,053
Are you all right?

247
00:21:56,971 --> 00:21:57,805
Yes.

248
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:05,229
To be honest, I'm a little nervous.

249
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:07,648
I'm nervous.

250
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:15,698
There are a lot of cameras and people.

251
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:19,285
And everyone seems to get along
like a team, except you.

252
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,495
Exactly. How did you know?

253
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,123
It's the same for me.

254
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:27,209
Oh, I see.

255
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:51,192
I knew you had your ambitions,
but this is a surprise.

256
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:56,989
Come on. I've got a date with Cho-hui.

257
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,998
Before the special date,

258
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:10,252
we have a special offer for Cho-hui,
who has just joined us.

259
00:23:10,252 --> 00:23:13,881
If you want,
you can invite someone else to your date.

260
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:16,050
There can be a third person.

261
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:37,780
Ki-baek, do you want to join us?

262
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:46,247
You were right.
The new girl is certainly a pot stirrer.

263
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:48,791
And your decision to let her choose...

264
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,044
No. It's very good.

265
00:23:53,254 --> 00:23:55,256
This is going to be a game changer.

266
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,050
Everyone's first love has shown up.

267
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,594
It's going to shake things up like crazy.

268
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,569
Oh, Yeon.

269
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:17,736
Back there.

270
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:18,988
I'll get it.

271
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:24,201
- I'm okay. It's heavy.
- I got it.

272
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,786
Goodness. Wow.

273
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:27,997
How are you doing?

274
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:30,791
If the work is too much,
just let me know, okay?

275
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,376
There's a lot for me to do here.

276
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:34,587
Moving stuff, taking care of my brother,

277
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:36,547
and taking care of you.

278
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:56,400
Well...

279
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:00,821
I'm sorry.

280
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:05,534
I understand.

281
00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:11,165
I guess you found Cho-hui in my notebook,

282
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:13,167
connected the dots to Jeong-heon,

283
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:16,712
<i>and learned about
the other guys through her.</i>

284
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:21,383
And that must have given you
the idea for the show.

285
00:25:23,928 --> 00:25:25,638
You're not mad at me?

286
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,725
I gave you that notebook to read.

287
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:33,395
I can't say that I wasn't surprised,

288
00:25:34,563 --> 00:25:37,858
but I'm the one who gave it to you,
so of course, I understand.

289
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,286
I'm sorry. I'll leave you guys to talk.

290
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:52,289
Thank you.

291
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:04,009
Thank you for earlier.

292
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,136
You really helped me relax.

293
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,930
Feeling better now?

294
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:10,474
Actually,

295
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:13,936
it wasn't easy for me
to decide to come on the show.

296
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:17,898
But this is just as hard as I thought.

297
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,904
I feel like I'm bothering you all
by showing up here, complicating things.

298
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:27,658
I want to do well
since I'm already here, but...

299
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,953
But you don't really know
what to do, right?

300
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:32,746
Exactly.

301
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:38,210
But one of the reasons
why I decided to do this...

302
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,923
was because I missed you, Ki-baek.

303
00:26:46,427 --> 00:26:51,056
<i>They say you don't forget your first love
but bury it in your heart.</i>

304
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:56,020
So you can always dig it back up again.

305
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:00,816
He and his friend like the same girl.

306
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:04,486
It's Seong-bin, right?
The kid who gets stocks for New Year's?

307
00:27:04,486 --> 00:27:06,280
Why are you so immature?

308
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:11,118
If Ms. Na tells my mom, she'll be upset.

309
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:15,122
Gu-won told Seong-bin his secret,
but he told everyone about it.

310
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:16,665
It's not my secret!

311
00:27:16,665 --> 00:27:18,584
I've never told that to anyone but you!

312
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:21,795
And it wasn't because
I wanted your pity or help!

313
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:23,672
Why are you so twisted?

314
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:24,757
That's it.

315
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:27,384
What the hell do you know about me?

316
00:27:31,972 --> 00:27:33,307
What are you guys doing?

317
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:38,729
<i>Two guys liking the same girl.
How's that a secret?</i>

318
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:43,067
Oh, dear. It's okay.

319
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:45,986
Hey!

320
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:47,988
Gu-won, you know what?

321
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:52,576
Ki-baek used to write
in his journal every night

322
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:55,454
about his first love or something too.

323
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:58,040
Don't you remember?

324
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,877
I think it was his senior year,
on the birthday of the girl he liked.

325
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:03,921
That's right.

326
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:05,255
It was his senior year.

327
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:08,634
He had a huge fight with his friend,
and you were totally flabbergasted.

328
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:10,260
- You remember, right?
- Exactly.

329
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,639
He had never in his life
caused trouble like that.

330
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:15,933
It's the good kids
who cause big trouble, Mom.

331
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:16,975
For goodness' sake.

332
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:19,019
That's your brother you're talking about.

333
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:21,605
Go on and eat.

334
00:28:23,774 --> 00:28:24,775
You're right.

335
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:27,111
It was that one time

336
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:29,488
when Ki-baek...

337
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,492
bared his soul.

338
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,289
Mr. Song.

339
00:28:43,836 --> 00:28:47,172
Why do you think it's all your fault?

340
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:55,889
What are you two whispering about?

341
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:00,269
I think it's a secret.

342
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:07,735
Wow, you look beautiful.

343
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,194
You look gorgeous.

344
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:10,446
Enjoy your food, guys.

345
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:13,741
Gu-won, don't miss the academy bus.

346
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,243
- Okay.
- And turn off the lights when you leave.

347
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:17,536
Yes, don't worry.

348
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:21,248
All right, see you later. She's glowing.

349
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:25,252
Perfect.

350
00:29:59,953 --> 00:30:00,788
Remember these?

351
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:03,999
Schisandra flowers.

352
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:05,083
In early summer,

353
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:08,212
they grew against the wall
outside your house.

354
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:11,965
In the language of flowers...

355
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:16,720
they mean, "Let's meet again."

356
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:55,384
Did you know that Cho-hui was coming here?

357
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:57,302
Does it even matter?

358
00:30:58,637 --> 00:30:59,513
Hello, Jeong-heon.

359
00:30:59,513 --> 00:31:01,890
My daughter's a fan.
Could she get a picture with you?

360
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,892
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

361
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,186
Jeong-heon is really popular.

362
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:07,729
Right?

363
00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:10,816
I haven't been
to an amusement park in ages.

364
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,401
Really?

365
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,698
Today, I wish I were in your shoes, man.

366
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:20,200
This is supposed to be a date
but it seems impossible.

367
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,918
Ki-baek, are you going to be okay?

368
00:31:29,918 --> 00:31:32,337
You got scared
during the horror game and fell over.

369
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,759
Oh, if Ki-baek can't go on the rides,
I'm fine just watching.

370
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:40,721
I tripped, okay?

371
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:42,723
Scared? Oh, please.

372
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:46,310
Who's scared?
What's there to be scared of?

373
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,394
Song Ki-baek!

374
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:49,605
Mr. Nostrils.

375
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:17,799
Come on, let's go on a scary ride.

376
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,226
Isn't this a scary one?

377
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:30,687
I've got you. Don't worry. It's okay.

378
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:34,608
Worry about yourself
or you'll bounce like popcorn.

379
00:32:35,943 --> 00:32:37,069
Popcorn?

380
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:39,029
- Cho-hui, hold on tight.
- Okay.

381
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:44,368
You've set up cameras on it, right?

382
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,244
Yes.

383
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:48,622
It'd look better
with more people on the ride,

384
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:50,290
so the writers should go on it too.

385
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,375
Let's do that.

386
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:55,379
Including you.

387
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:56,588
What?

388
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:58,215
Why are you doing this to me?

389
00:32:58,215 --> 00:33:00,175
Come on, you're the head writer.

390
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:02,844
You've got to teach them
how to be funny on variety shows.

391
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:04,846
But...

392
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:18,735
- Guys, let's all sit over here.
- Okay.

393
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,370
All right, today's a special day.
Who's ready to kick it up a notch?

394
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,747
Let's make it thrilling. Let's go.

395
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,626
- Cho-hui, are you okay?
- Yes.

396
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:37,045
For God's sake.

397
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:41,049
It's moving. It's fast.

398
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:43,969
What makes someone
everyone's ideal son-in-law?

399
00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:47,472
Strength. Let's see
how strong they are. Pang!

400
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:53,895
Let go of the railing.

401
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:55,230
Hold on tight!

402
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,858
Just follow your body,
follow your heart. Pang, pang!

403
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:05,365
God.

404
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:09,077
Now, we've got the show's head writer.
Let's see how strong she is. Pang!

405
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:21,923
Ms. On!

406
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,562
What are you doing? Let go of me!

407
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:36,980
I got you.

408
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:40,275
Let go of me!

409
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:42,611
I got you. Don't worry.

410
00:34:43,236 --> 00:34:45,989
Just hang on. Try to-- No, stop.

411
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,949
Ms. On!

412
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:49,826
Ms. On!

413
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:52,454
Ms. On!

414
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:00,545
Ms. On!

415
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:02,964
We'll just have them go on the ride again.

416
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:05,425
- Ms. On!
- Man...

417
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:16,353
Let's take a short break.

418
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:20,023
You can go grab some coffee
if you want but don't go too far.

419
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:22,442
- Okay. Coffee? Sounds good.
- Cool.

420
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:25,612
Guys, gather around.

421
00:35:25,612 --> 00:35:26,947
Let's have a talk.

422
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:29,407
I-na, go with the cast members.

423
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:31,201
Okay. They have coffee over there.

424
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:44,589
- Can I put my arm around you?
- What are you doing?

425
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:48,260
- Take a picture.
- Nice. Give a thumbs-up.

426
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,387
Wow, that's great. That's it.

427
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:54,683
He was bragging about how popular he is,
and he got what he asked for.

428
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:56,434
Serves you right, you jerk.

429
00:35:57,227 --> 00:35:58,687
Are you guys all friends?

430
00:35:58,687 --> 00:36:01,314
Wow! I've never met a celebrity.
Is she your girlfriend?

431
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:04,192
She's a celebrity too.

432
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:05,777
- Oh!
- Hey, she's a celebrity!

433
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,445
- I'll get a picture.
- She's pretty.

434
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:08,530
Go get some people.

435
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,157
- Oh, okay.
- Go with her.

436
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:12,576
Take a nice one.

437
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,411
Get in there. All together.

438
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:16,163
- All of you.
- Let's take some pics.

439
00:36:16,163 --> 00:36:18,248
Come on. One, two, three.

440
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:19,541
- Four, five. Nice.
- Really?

441
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:22,210
It looks awesome with the Ferris wheel.

442
00:36:22,836 --> 00:36:23,837
It looks great!

443
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,423
You guys have fun.

444
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:27,549
Hey, bro!

445
00:36:28,758 --> 00:36:29,634
Buy us some coffee.

446
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:32,304
- You nutjob. What are you, a thug?
- What?

447
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:35,640
- Ask him to send you a gift card.
- Come on. You're loaded.

448
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,058
You should thank us for that.

449
00:36:37,058 --> 00:36:40,520
- Cut it out. You're acting like a psycho!
- Are these designer clothes?

450
00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:42,856
You're right! They're designer...

451
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:54,492
Jeong-heon! Kim Jeong-heon!

452
00:36:58,038 --> 00:36:59,039
Who's he?

453
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:01,625
Everyone's ideal son-in-law
or everyone's doormat?

454
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:03,877
Hey.

455
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:05,420
Just go over there.

456
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,009
You see him on TV,
and you think he's your friend?

457
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:15,513
But he doesn't know you.

458
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:18,183
You came here to have fun
wearing nice clothes and shoes,

459
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:19,643
so just do what you came for.

460
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:24,564
Look, mister. Who are you to lecture us?

461
00:37:24,564 --> 00:37:27,025
Wait, babe. He's that guy.

462
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,945
From that YouTube video.
You know, up his nose--

463
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:32,656
- That dude whose face got--
- The one with the nostrils.

464
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:34,241
- You're right!
- It's him!

465
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:35,617
That guy?

466
00:37:35,617 --> 00:37:37,077
I can't believe these kids.

467
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:39,829
What? What are you going to do?

468
00:37:41,915 --> 00:37:46,002
I'll teach you a lesson.

469
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:48,171
- You nutjob.
- Mister.

470
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:51,174
Mind your own damn business
and just keep walking.

471
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:53,051
Go straight that way. Yes.

472
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:54,135
Why?

473
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,764
Why "bro" for him but "mister" for me?

474
00:37:57,764 --> 00:38:01,601
Why call him "bro" and me "mister"
in front of all these people?

475
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:06,064
- Everyone's taking our picture. Let's go.
- Do something.

476
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:10,110
Hey, why are you filming us
without permission?

477
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,569
We have-- What's it called?

478
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:13,238
We have portrait rules, okay?

479
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:14,823
- We have portrait rules!
- Stop!

480
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:16,658
It's portrait rights, guys.

481
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:18,910
It's portrait rights, not portrait rules!

482
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,578
I've had enough of this guy.

483
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:23,665
Who cares if it's portrait rules
or portrait rights?

484
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:25,125
Who cares?

485
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:27,877
I'm sorry.

486
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:30,338
- What?
- What?

487
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:36,219
In a situation like this,
you say "I'm sorry" and leave.

488
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:38,263
You know you've done something wrong.

489
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:43,685
And you people.
Are you just going to keep filming?

490
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:46,021
What are you going to do with the footage?

491
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:49,941
Are you going to put it on the Internet,
find out who they are and punish them?

492
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:51,818
Is that the right way to educate them?

493
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:54,779
Isn't it your responsibility as adults

494
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:57,073
to give them guidance
before they stray further--

495
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,117
- What are you doing?
- Just come.

496
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,493
Hey.

497
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:02,245
Hey, put me down.

498
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:03,913
Put me down now!

499
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:07,292
Just stay still before I knock you out.

500
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:11,713
- Please delete the photos.
- Are you okay?

501
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:14,924
- I'm sorry. No pictures, please.
- Thank you.

502
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:16,468
- All right, come on.
- Thank you.

503
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:18,553
Could you delete the photos?

504
00:39:18,553 --> 00:39:20,305
- I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorry.

505
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:38,031
Are you okay?

506
00:39:43,787 --> 00:39:45,372
I got slapped in the face once

507
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:48,458
for not smiling for a picture.

508
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,711
This is not a big deal.

509
00:39:57,884 --> 00:40:00,553
If you're having a hard time,
talk to someone.

510
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,806
Anyone.

511
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:06,267
You can talk to me too.

512
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,231
It's nothing.

513
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:21,866
Where's Ki-baek?

514
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:30,375
You should've stayed out of it.
Didn't you know you'd cause trouble?

515
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:34,462
I'm sorry.

516
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,131
I mean it.

517
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:39,634
I never meant to
cause problems for the show.

518
00:40:42,262 --> 00:40:46,141
You can't make a scene like that
without thinking about the consequences.

519
00:41:00,363 --> 00:41:01,823
Just go ahead and say it.

520
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:03,283
If you consider consequences,

521
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:07,245
how could you use someone's personal,
private memories for your TV show?

522
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:10,915
Did you think about how much
it would hurt and shock me?

523
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,877
But you said you understood.

524
00:41:13,877 --> 00:41:17,714
I feel betrayed,
like I can't trust anyone in the world.

525
00:41:17,714 --> 00:41:20,216
It hurts. I'm hurt.

526
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:26,639
I'm sorry.

527
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:30,727
I did think you might feel betrayed.

528
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:34,772
I deserve to be called selfish,
but what I saw in that notebook was--

529
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:35,857
But...

530
00:41:39,694 --> 00:41:41,988
I'm trying to understand you...

531
00:41:44,073 --> 00:41:47,202
because I was the one
who gave you my notebook.

532
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:53,416
Besides, I know you didn't mean any harm...

533
00:41:57,212 --> 00:41:59,339
given the reason why

534
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,801
you brought me here.

535
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:11,851
I'm doing all sorts of things
that'll make people hate me,

536
00:42:11,851 --> 00:42:13,478
but I'm still going to do my best

537
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:16,189
to not be the worst guy.

538
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:18,900
I'll try.

539
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,951
WAITING ROOM
TICKETS

540
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:34,707
I guess that's the character
he's going with.

541
00:42:34,707 --> 00:42:37,961
He made a mess,
but I'm sure our bosses will clean it up.

542
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:40,129
From today, Ki-baek is my favorite.

543
00:42:40,964 --> 00:42:44,467
Maybe it's because he's an announcer.
He's so logical even when he lashes out.

544
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:48,721
It felt so cathartic
hearing him talk earlier.

545
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:50,557
I'm totally charmed.

546
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,308
- Already?
- Isn't he charming?

547
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:54,852
People do like
someone outspoken these days.

548
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:56,062
Like my Ki-baek.

549
00:42:56,813 --> 00:42:58,022
He's cool.

550
00:42:58,523 --> 00:42:59,774
- He's cool.
- So charming.

551
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:01,776
He's totally my type.

552
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:14,497
By the way,
don't you think Ki-baek is kind of cute?

553
00:43:15,248 --> 00:43:17,458
I find him adorable
when he gets all flustered.

554
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:21,421
Oh, is he not like that with you yet?

555
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:25,049
I guess things are still awkward
between you two.

556
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:27,135
You're his first love,
but it's been decades.

557
00:43:31,723 --> 00:43:34,100
- Someone's calling you.
- Sorry?

558
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:35,977
Your phone.

559
00:43:35,977 --> 00:43:38,771
Oh, it's fine.

560
00:43:41,608 --> 00:43:43,943
Can I drop the formalities
and call you Cho-hui?

561
00:43:44,777 --> 00:43:46,529
Did you say you were 37?

562
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:48,323
Was it 38?

563
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:54,203
You're the same age as Ki-baek.

564
00:43:54,203 --> 00:43:57,957
So you're 33, right?

565
00:43:57,957 --> 00:43:59,250
Yes.

566
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,466
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

567
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,016
- By the way, are you guys okay?
- Heard you got into a fight at the park.

568
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,977
I lost my temper and made a scene.

569
00:44:17,977 --> 00:44:21,648
Thank you for your concern, and I'm sorry.

570
00:44:21,648 --> 00:44:25,443
Well, it's all settled,
and Ki-baek did nothing wrong.

571
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:28,988
Actually, people are saying
Ki-baek was super cool.

572
00:44:28,988 --> 00:44:33,409
I-na did my interview earlier,
and she went on and on about Ki-baek.

573
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:35,286
It's like she wanted to be in the show.

574
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:38,956
I heard it was pretty rough on you,
Jeong-heon. Are you all right?

575
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:40,875
Oh, yes. I'm fine.

576
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,919
You guys went to the same school, right?

577
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:45,421
Ki-baek helped Jeong-heon big time today.

578
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:48,883
Thanks, Ki-baek.

579
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:54,180
Still, it must've been nice.
I wanted a date at an amusement park.

580
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:56,224
Now I feel bad.

581
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:00,520
Still, I'm happy we have another girl.

582
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,896
I have a roommate now.

583
00:45:03,106 --> 00:45:05,650
Cho-hui, this is really good. Try it.

584
00:45:06,234 --> 00:45:07,610
Oh, thank you.

585
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,199
My ankle still hurts.

586
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,493
I hurt it
during the horror game yesterday.

587
00:45:17,412 --> 00:45:18,621
It was your right ankle.

588
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:27,547
Hey, can I see you for a second?

589
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:29,173
- Why?
- Come on.

590
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,050
What is it?

591
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:33,803
She's funny.

592
00:45:35,096 --> 00:45:36,431
I think she did it on purpose.

593
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,184
Talking about an incident between us
that you don't know about.

594
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,604
It's childish but effective.

595
00:45:43,604 --> 00:45:44,689
Is it?

596
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:58,161
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

597
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:02,540
- <i>Happy birthday, dear Cho-hui</i>
- <i>Happy birthday, dear Cho-hui</i>

598
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,585
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

599
00:46:07,628 --> 00:46:09,547
I just put 30 candles on the cake.

600
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:12,049
I wanted to go with three,
but she stuck them all in.

601
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:15,261
Man, if we weren't out here on an island,
I would've gotten--

602
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:17,597
Hey, look at the flames.

603
00:46:17,597 --> 00:46:18,556
Blow them out.

604
00:46:22,768 --> 00:46:23,853
Happy birthday.

605
00:46:23,853 --> 00:46:25,062
Thank you.

606
00:46:31,444 --> 00:46:32,445
Hi, Mom.

607
00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:36,616
<i>You haven't returned
any of my calls all day.</i>

608
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:39,243
I've been busy. You know I'm at work.

609
00:46:40,286 --> 00:46:41,370
Did your date go well?

610
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,831
No, because I was worried
about my daughter.

611
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:47,210
Why work so hard you can't even have
seaweed soup on your birthday?

612
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:52,757
<i>I bet you're stuck in the countryside,
running around like a headless chicken,</i>

613
00:46:52,757 --> 00:46:55,051
<i>not even having time to shower.</i>

614
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:56,928
I'm the head writer, Mom.

615
00:46:56,928 --> 00:46:58,804
All I do now is give orders.

616
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:04,227
I am celebrating my birthday here,

617
00:47:04,227 --> 00:47:07,188
so you can enjoy the seaweed soup.
You worked hard to raise me.

618
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:09,899
I made it with a ton of top-quality beef.

619
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:12,109
I'll save you some.
Good luck with your work.

620
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,488
<i>Happy birthday, sweetheart.</i>

621
00:47:15,488 --> 00:47:17,031
Thanks.

622
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:18,366
Chug it!

623
00:47:18,366 --> 00:47:21,661
- Chug, come on.
- I'll do it.

624
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:25,540
- Chug it!
- Chug it!

625
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:33,172
That's enough.

626
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:35,591
- Cho-hui, are you okay?
- We'll wrap it up here, guys.

627
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:38,844
- We'll do the individual interviews later.
- Okay.

628
00:47:38,844 --> 00:47:45,560
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

629
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,854
- <i>Happy birthday, dear Woo-ju</i>
- <i>Happy birthday</i>

630
00:47:48,854 --> 00:47:49,772
We got you a cake.

631
00:47:49,772 --> 00:47:53,526
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

632
00:47:57,697 --> 00:47:58,531
Blow them out.

633
00:47:58,531 --> 00:47:59,991
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

634
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:01,993
Pretty. Blow out the candles.

635
00:48:01,993 --> 00:48:03,035
Okay.

636
00:48:03,536 --> 00:48:04,870
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
WOO-JU

637
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,247
Happy birthday, Ms. On.

638
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:07,331
I didn't know.

639
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:09,875
Thank you.

640
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:11,294
God, I'm sorry, Woo-ju.

641
00:48:11,294 --> 00:48:14,297
I feel terrible.
That's supposed to be our job.

642
00:48:14,297 --> 00:48:17,508
Hey, who celebrates birthdays on set?

643
00:48:18,092 --> 00:48:19,844
Oh, happy birthday.

644
00:48:21,053 --> 00:48:23,264
My team is good at their jobs.

645
00:48:25,808 --> 00:48:28,185
Woo-ju, please kill me.

646
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:31,022
I cannot believe I forgot your birthday.

647
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:33,608
Stop it.
Since when do we celebrate birthdays?

648
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:35,860
- Woo-ju, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

649
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,695
Happy birthday, Ms. On.

650
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:39,905
Happy birthday.

651
00:48:40,823 --> 00:48:43,743
A birthday party while we're busy?
Can't they do it later?

652
00:48:43,743 --> 00:48:45,578
We've got equipment to disassemble.

653
00:48:46,912 --> 00:48:47,872
Oh, you know what?

654
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:51,167
I'm just really tired.
Let's call it a night here, shall we?

655
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:54,128
- You should go rest. Good night.
- Let's go.

656
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:56,631
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

657
00:48:56,631 --> 00:48:59,550
Thanks. Go on, guys.
I'll just clean up here a little.

658
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,594
Good night.

659
00:49:01,594 --> 00:49:02,970
Min-gu.

660
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,388
Come on, Min-gu.

661
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:06,223
Hey, I-na.

662
00:49:14,732 --> 00:49:17,193
You met your first love again today.

663
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:18,694
Did your feelings change?

664
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,323
You're mad, aren't you?

665
00:49:23,783 --> 00:49:26,911
I may not know much about other stuff,
but I can tell when you're mad.

666
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:31,290
You met your first love again today.

667
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,792
Did your feelings change?

668
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:36,128
Yes.

669
00:49:36,921 --> 00:49:38,381
I keep liking her more and more.

670
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:40,758
A lot more than I used to.

671
00:49:43,177 --> 00:49:44,428
What made you feel that way?

672
00:49:45,554 --> 00:49:48,641
Because I can now do all the things
I couldn't do for her before.

673
00:49:52,186 --> 00:49:55,106
I've never been able to celebrate
her birthday, but now I can.

674
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:02,738
I made some mistakes in the past,
and I didn't express my feelings.

675
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,075
Maybe I can express them now.

676
00:50:10,162 --> 00:50:12,498
Your mistakes. Your feelings.

677
00:50:15,668 --> 00:50:17,712
When you're in a relationship,
there are times

678
00:50:18,587 --> 00:50:20,631
when it should be about them, not you.

679
00:50:21,882 --> 00:50:23,718
I'm sure you know that,

680
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:28,431
but I'm saying this, hoping that things
will go well between you and Cho-hui.

681
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,126
You're still up.

682
00:50:58,794 --> 00:51:00,963
The others went out
to play with some fireworks.

683
00:51:01,464 --> 00:51:04,175
Right. I can't sleep.
I've got a lot on my mind.

684
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:09,221
Earlier at the amusement park,

685
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:11,682
I was a bit surprised.

686
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:14,560
You seem to have changed a lot.

687
00:51:16,228 --> 00:51:17,480
You're right.

688
00:51:18,647 --> 00:51:20,357
Have I changed a lot too?

689
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:23,861
No.

690
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:29,033
To me, you're still the Min Cho-hui I knew
from Minseong High School.

691
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:31,452
It's true.

692
00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:37,750
Can I...

693
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,296
ask about your feelings?

694
00:51:45,674 --> 00:51:48,010
Is there anyone that...

695
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:51,180
you like here?

696
00:51:52,306 --> 00:51:53,140
There is.

697
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,269
Is there a chance that it's me?

698
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:58,395
No.

699
00:52:00,648 --> 00:52:01,649
Sorry.

700
00:52:02,608 --> 00:52:03,818
But it's not you.

701
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:06,654
Right.

702
00:52:06,654 --> 00:52:09,281
I'm sure a lot of things happened
before I came here.

703
00:52:10,783 --> 00:52:12,076
As expected, this is hard.

704
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:16,080
Yes, a lot of things happened.

705
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:19,416
So many things happened.

706
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:27,550
Still, you can't be sure your feelings
will stay the same tomorrow.

707
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,011
I mean, feelings can change many times
even in a day, right?

708
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:34,014
Right. That's the problem.

709
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:36,976
You want to understand, but you can't.

710
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:41,313
You decide not to tell anyone,
but then you want to.

711
00:52:41,313 --> 00:52:45,484
You know it's better not to do anything,
but it's all you want to do.

712
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:46,735
That's the problem.

713
00:52:47,695 --> 00:52:48,696
Yes.

714
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:53,951
That's why I hope you and I can be honest
with each other while we're here--

715
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:55,828
I should just be honest.

716
00:52:56,662 --> 00:52:57,663
What?

717
00:52:58,747 --> 00:53:02,167
Humans are complex beings, you know.

718
00:53:07,381 --> 00:53:08,716
Thanks, Cho-hui.

719
00:53:08,716 --> 00:53:10,676
I've got to go.

720
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:15,556
Get a good night's sleep.
The schedule is crazy here.

721
00:53:15,556 --> 00:53:18,142
Forget all the dating shows
you watched for reference.

722
00:53:41,332 --> 00:53:43,542
Is something the matter?

723
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:56,347
I...

724
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:00,059
will not confess my feelings.

725
00:54:01,143 --> 00:54:01,977
What?

726
00:54:01,977 --> 00:54:03,395
In disaster movies,

727
00:54:03,395 --> 00:54:07,066
those who survive in the end always
think they love each other and kiss.

728
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:09,485
I've never thought that was real love.

729
00:54:11,987 --> 00:54:14,531
That's just camaraderie
from surviving a crisis together.

730
00:54:15,908 --> 00:54:19,244
I thought that's what you and I had.

731
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:27,211
It is. That's what we have.

732
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:31,173
No, it's not. I don't want to survive
a life-or-death crisis with you.

733
00:54:34,093 --> 00:54:38,639
Because I don't want you to be in danger
or to see you suffer.

734
00:54:51,652 --> 00:54:54,321
But I don't want you to avoid me
with that look on your face.

735
00:54:58,158 --> 00:54:59,159
That's why

736
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:01,996
I'm not going to confess.

737
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:07,626
The rule of this show is to date
in front of the cameras,

738
00:55:08,836 --> 00:55:09,795
and I won't break it.

739
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:15,175
All right.

740
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:18,637
But,

741
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:22,391
there's something I want to do instead.

742
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:26,311
What's that?

743
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:36,030
- Celebrate your birthday.
- What?

744
00:55:38,532 --> 00:55:40,576
You're so unpredictable, Ki-baek.

745
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:43,912
All right. Let's celebrate.

746
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:45,914
- Hold this.
- What?

747
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:51,295
You remembered.

748
00:55:51,962 --> 00:55:54,465
Spicy food is
the best kind of food there is.

749
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,092
You're just being tricked.

750
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,886
By who?

751
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,387
By trotters?

752
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:02,598
Spiciness is a kind of pain sensation,

753
00:56:02,598 --> 00:56:04,099
so when you eat spicy food,

754
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:07,770
the brain perceives it as pain
and releases hormones like endorphins.

755
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,981
So, spicy food improves your mood?

756
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:13,484
No, you're being tricked.

757
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:15,486
So what if it's a trick?

758
00:56:15,486 --> 00:56:18,447
You can think your brain is
working hard to make you feel better.

759
00:56:19,364 --> 00:56:23,035
If you're going to lecture me,
put it back in here. Just don't eat it.

760
00:56:23,035 --> 00:56:25,496
I wasn't refusing to eat it,
just sharing what I knew.

761
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:26,914
Why tell me not to eat?

762
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:32,211
This is exactly what I wanted.
How did you know?

763
00:56:32,795 --> 00:56:35,297
"When life throws too much spice at you,
don't back down.

764
00:56:35,297 --> 00:56:36,840
You should be just as spicy."

765
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,552
You eat spicy food
when you're stressed out.

766
00:56:42,096 --> 00:56:44,848
You've looked stressed
the whole time here.

767
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:48,602
I brought this too.

768
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:52,773
You brought a lot of things.

769
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:56,735
Wow.

770
00:56:56,735 --> 00:57:00,155
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

771
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:05,285
<i>Happy birthday, Woo-ju
Happy birthday to you</i>

772
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,121
Blow it out.

773
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:09,998
Come on, harder.

774
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,131
Applause.

775
00:57:23,303 --> 00:57:24,304
Try it.

776
00:57:33,772 --> 00:57:35,107
You've got to taste this.

777
00:57:42,114 --> 00:57:42,948
It's good, right?

778
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:46,285
I can't really eat spicy food.

779
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:53,333
Wow, it's really good.

780
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:08,765
That's pretty.

781
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,734
Yes, pretty.

782
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,003
Thank you.

783
00:58:39,922 --> 00:58:41,548
For not confessing your feelings.

784
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:46,637
And for celebrating my birthday.

785
00:59:22,673 --> 00:59:23,799
Woo-ju.

786
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:25,551
Yes?

787
00:59:25,551 --> 00:59:26,969
We've got a serious problem.

788
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,179
What is it?

789
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:36,144
<i>There has been a big change
since last night.</i>

790
00:59:37,563 --> 00:59:40,315
<i>One of the contestants has left the show.</i>

791
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:43,026
That stupid girl
thought she was so clever.

792
00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:48,657
Ki-baek.

793
00:59:50,158 --> 00:59:50,993
What?

794
00:59:51,577 --> 00:59:52,995
Woo-ju and I used to date.

795
00:59:55,664 --> 00:59:58,041
Does that matter at this point?

796
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:00,252
Yes.

797
01:00:01,753 --> 01:00:02,754
It will.

798
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:09,011
So we came up
with an alternative for everyone.

799
01:00:11,597 --> 01:00:16,268
Please welcome
our new member to the group.

800
01:00:38,123 --> 01:00:40,709
Hello, I'm the new contestant

801
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:44,129
On Woo-ju.
