FRANKLY SPEAKING 💞 @ kissasian.one

00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:28,245
What the...

3
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:34,001
Oh... You woke up.

4
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:44,386
You shouldn't see that. It's...

5
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:46,096
{\an8}YEON
WHAT IS GOING ON?

6
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:49,224
{\an8}COUPLE'S PARADISE!
EVERYTHING WAS A LIE?!

7
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,482
<i>Ki-baek... isn't my boyfriend.</i>

8
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:01,069
- Wait, what on earth...
- <i>Ki-baek and Ms. On Woo-ju.</i>

9
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,115
<i>They were already a couple before
we started filming</i> Couple's Paradise<i>.</i>

10
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:08,744
<i>Ms. On got jealous of
her boyfriend's love interest in the show,</i>

11
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:12,414
<i>Ms. Choi Yu-yeong,
and kicked her off the show in the end.</i>

12
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:15,542
<i>Regarding this matter,
the production crew</i>...

EPISODE 10: A BOLT FROM THE BLUE

14
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:21,423
<i>Whoa, no way! Mom!</i>

15
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:22,716
{\an8}What's the matter?

16
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,134
{\an8}- Mom.
- What is it?

17
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:26,178
{\an8}- Ki-baek's love life is on the news!
- What?

18
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:28,847
{\an8}That only happens to famous people--

19
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:30,557
{\an8}My goodness!

20
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:34,144
- Ki-baek is famous, isn't he?
- Don't be surprised.

21
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:36,521
LET US LOVE EACH OTHER

22
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:37,814
"On Woo-ju"?

23
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:40,192
Ms. On's daughter?

24
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:43,862
WE'RE CLOSED TODAY
MADAME ON

25
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,641
I'm sorry!

26
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:19,314
- I'm sorry.
- Let's discuss what we're going to do.

27
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:22,067
But why are they discussing it here?

28
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,820
Should I go get some fruit for everyone?

29
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:28,323
People keep showing up at the TV station

30
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:31,118
and our meeting room
to make a fuss about it.

31
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:34,705
And if people see you two together,
it won't do us any good.

32
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,918
All right. In the video
that Min Cho-hui posted,

33
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,213
she takes issue with two things.
Number one.

34
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:45,757
Ki-baek and Ms. On Woo-ju.
They were already a couple

35
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:48,719
before we started filming
<i>Couple's Paradise</i>.

36
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,095
Hold tight!

37
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,849
{\an8}<i>And that's how Song Ki-baek,
who wasn't well-known, got cast</i>

38
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,392
thanks to the head writer.

39
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:57,602
Your daughter has that much influence?

40
00:04:57,602 --> 00:04:58,645
Influence? No.

41
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,898
I ask for a celebrity's autograph,
and she says it's abuse of power--

42
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:04,276
- Mom. I didn't do that.
- You did!

43
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:06,361
Now, number two.

44
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:10,073
Ms. On got jealous of
her boyfriend's love interest in the show...

45
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:13,160
On Woo-ju revealed her ambition
to become a celebrity,

46
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:17,247
kicked Choi Yu-yeong off the show,
and took her place.

47
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:19,833
Interesting.

48
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,753
First, let me go talk to Min Cho-hui.

49
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:26,340
You can't. She's already gone to France.

50
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,257
What?

51
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:29,968
She screwed us over and fled.

52
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,889
Should we go to France to find her?

53
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,891
Let me get the facts straight.

54
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:39,353
Your relationship began
after <i>Couple's Paradise</i>,

55
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:42,647
and the person who drove off
Yu-yeong was Cho-hui. Correct?

56
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:44,274
- Yes.
- Yes, that's right.

57
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:49,488
Well, then, should we think
about how to argue this?

58
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:54,826
We can argue all we want,
but there's no proof.

59
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,412
Would that work?

60
00:05:57,412 --> 00:05:59,498
What else then? We do nothing?

61
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:01,291
Man, I don't know.

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,045
What if we're just giving people
another form of entertainment?

63
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,652
Man, this is completely untrue.

64
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:33,031
What are you up to?

65
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:34,950
Why'd you make rice balls?

66
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:37,661
They're combat rations.

67
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:48,255
COUPLE'S PARADISE

68
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,218
GENIE EDU

69
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,558
IS IT TRUE ABOUT SONG KI-BAEK?
POOR CHO-HUI

70
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:01,268
THIS IS ALL JUST A BIG PR STUNT

71
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,519
ISN'T THIS A MEDIA STUNT?

72
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,604
WHY THE BIG DEAL
OVER SOME ORDINARY PEOPLE?

73
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:08,608
I HATE ON WOO-JU MORE

74
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:09,985
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:14,865
ANYWAY,
SONG KI-BAEK TOTALLY SUCKS

76
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:17,159
<i>Ki-baek.</i>

77
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,120
Are you dating On Woo-ju?

78
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:21,830
Yes.

79
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:28,295
From now on, your answer
to every question should be no.

80
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:30,380
All right?

81
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:33,842
You must have an interview to explain it.

82
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:35,677
You and Ms. On Woo-ju have to

83
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:38,847
get your acts together,
or you'll both go down.

84
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:42,350
You don't have any feelings
for each other.

85
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,020
There's nothing going on between you two.

86
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:51,026
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

87
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:55,572
<i>Happy birthday, dear Cho-hui</i>

88
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:58,408
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

89
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,912
<i>I just put 30 candles on the cake.</i>

90
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:04,456
<i>I wanted to go with three,
but she stuck them all in.</i>

91
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:12,672
{\an8}YOU'RE SO CRAZY ABOUT MEN...
APOLOGIZE TO CHO-HUI

92
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,633
{\an8}YOU TOYED WITH SOMEONE'S FEELINGS
JUST DIE

93
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:19,262
0 FOLLOWERS

94
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,313
<i>You blew out
all those candles like a champ.</i>

95
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:29,439
<i>Yeah, totally.</i>

96
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,525
It was this night for sure.

97
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:34,945
<i>Thanks, everyone.</i>

98
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,489
<i>Can't believe today's your birthday.</i>

99
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,378
Is it true our show may not continue?

100
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:54,798
They've already taken it off
the on-demand streaming service.

101
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:57,592
And they shut down
the viewers' comment section.

102
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,805
You all look pretty chill.

103
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:04,724
Am I the only one who's worried
the show might be canceled?

104
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:06,893
Chief.

105
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:11,690
I get that you're upset,
but we're the victims here.

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,657
Woo-ju. I'm so disappointed.
I'm upset and sad.

107
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:22,659
I'm sorry, Chief.

108
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:26,538
No, no. If you were sorry,
you wouldn't be here.

109
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:30,333
If you're really sorry,
you should go out there and tell everyone

110
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:35,005
that there's nothing going on between you
and Song Ki-baek, don't you think?

111
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:37,382
- Chief.
- What?

112
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:40,635
- Come on, let's talk outside.
- What? Am I wrong?

113
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,012
Chief.

114
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,349
I'm sorry, guys.

115
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,270
If you say sorry,
it'll make us look like fools.

116
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,441
None of us did anything wrong.
All our efforts were genuine.

117
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,737
You're right. I'm not sorry, but...

118
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:01,823
Here. It's what you asked for.

119
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:08,705
Thanks.

120
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:25,722
I'm really not okay.

121
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:31,519
I'm screwed. I fell for you,
and now I'm totally screwed.

122
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,315
Well, who takes a couple picture
in the street anymore?

123
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:37,776
Everyone goes to
those photo booths nowadays.

124
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:40,070
Are you blaming me for that?

125
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,615
You were scowling at me
like you absolutely had to get a picture.

126
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,200
I didn't scowl at you.

127
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,370
I was looking at you because
you're pretty, and that's your fault.

128
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:51,623
Even if you thought I was pretty...

129
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,797
So, did Ms. Ma give you
a good dressing-down?

130
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:04,094
My agency wants me to do
an interview and explain.

131
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:06,721
Right.

132
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,391
That's the reasonable thing to do.

133
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,352
This all happened
because of someone's lies,

134
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:17,315
but to think that
we have to lie as well to fix it...

135
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,068
This is so hard.

136
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:24,531
What about you?
Did you get a good talking-to?

137
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:29,119
I'm thinking about quitting the Internet.

138
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:32,747
I told you not to read the comments.
You never listen to what I say.

139
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:36,084
I hope they know
we do read all those comments.

140
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:41,423
I wish it were just us reading them,
like private texts or emails.

141
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:48,555
No, that's not it.
On Woo-ju is the crazy bitch.

142
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:50,974
I knew something was off
when Choi Yu-yeong left.

143
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:55,728
She probably wanted to become
a celebrity too. She's a total nutcase.

144
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:58,356
The more I talk about her,
the angrier I get.

145
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:05,822
She's my daughter.

146
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,575
Oh, I see.

147
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:13,872
Ma'am, how much do I owe you?

148
00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:15,874
- You don't have to pay me.
- Sorry?

149
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:23,882
If you go out and take a left,
there's a new twisted donut place.

150
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:26,634
Use that money
to get yourself some donuts.

151
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:27,886
You'll feel better.

152
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:29,721
They're really good.

153
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,098
Okay.

154
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:48,948
KNOW THAT HATEFUL COMMENTS
ARE ALSO A FORM OF VIOLENCE

155
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,914
THEY DON'T DESERVE OUR LOVE

156
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:58,583
{\an8}SONG KI-BAEK!
AS A FAN, I TRUST YOU

00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:23,983
Where is everybody?

158
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,986
Mom and Pung-baek went out.

159
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,613
- And Dad?
- In his room.

160
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,659
He's been in there since yesterday.
What's he doing?

161
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:35,828
- Fighting.
- Fighting? Fighting who?

162
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,666
- Do you know Dad's on Instagram?
- Instagram?

163
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,209
He follows me and Pung-baek.

164
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:43,878
If you ever get an account, let him know.

165
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:51,386
He's been busy all day
reporting your haters

166
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:52,929
and replying to their comments.

167
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:13,533
Why did you want to see me?

168
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:16,578
What, are you here to see Woo-ju?

169
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:22,750
You've got a new habit of saying things
without filtering them through your brain.

170
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,963
You're just as thoughtless as I am.

171
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:31,009
So why did you want to see me?

172
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,886
No reason. Just checking in.

173
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:36,723
God, you know,
you're still as nosy as ever.

174
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:41,394
What? Are you going to get angry
at me again for being nosy?

175
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:45,315
That was ages ago.
And you came anyway knowing that I might.

176
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:46,858
Ki-baek.

177
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:03,875
What Un-beom gave you was supposed
to pay for his academy fees.

178
00:15:04,918 --> 00:15:06,836
I didn't tell my mom about your situation.

179
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:09,005
I just told her you were having trouble,

180
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:11,090
and she gave me my allowance in advance.

181
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,933
Did I ask you for money?

182
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:22,977
Come on. Don't take it that way.

183
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,110
I'm sorry if I offended you.

184
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:41,037
But you're my friend.
I didn't know about your situation before,

185
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:43,247
but now that I do, I can't just ignore it.

186
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:45,124
Are you really my friend?

187
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:50,505
Would a friend make you look
like a beggar?

188
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:53,800
Just admit that you feel superior
now that you know I'm flat broke

189
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:56,928
and not nearly as cool
as you thought I was.

190
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:59,013
I don't need your pity.

191
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:01,933
You have a successful dad,
so what would you know?

192
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,267
What did you just say?

193
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,108
- Let go! Damn it!
- Let go!

194
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:12,527
I just wanted to help you, you idiot!

195
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,570
I've never told that to anyone but you!

196
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,782
And it wasn't because
I wanted your pity or help!

197
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,492
I know.

198
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:24,455
I bet Ms. Ma is badgering you
to deny everything.

199
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:30,628
You know,
I never knew why people liked me,

200
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,088
but now they hate me.

201
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:35,049
It feels like they're beating me up,
but I can't even speak.

202
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,760
My heart races a dozen times a day.

203
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,306
Right, I didn't want to know that
in such detail.

204
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,393
How have you been dealing
with people like that?

205
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:47,228
Not everyone is like that.

206
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:51,649
You shouldn't try to be on top of things
at times like this.

207
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,819
- What?
- What people think about you?

208
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,530
You can't control that anyway.

209
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:01,492
You can't even control
what the woman you like thinks about you.

210
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:04,495
Just

211
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:07,081
do what you can do.

212
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,584
Which is what?

213
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:13,463
Even if people call you a fraud or a liar,

214
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:15,631
just continue to be yourself.

215
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:20,428
Then some of them will like you again,
and some will still hate you.

216
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,854
Thanks.

217
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:35,902
And I was

218
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:39,947
grateful to you back then,
though I never said it.

219
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:47,371
What are you saying?
Shut up. You're making me cringe.

220
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:47,181
- Who the hell are you?
- You bitch!

221
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:50,143
How dare you toy with someone's feelings?

222
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:52,728
- Call the police! Hurry!
- Let go!

223
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:53,771
Oh, right.

224
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:00,820
SEONGDONG POLICE STATION

225
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,953
Jesus, what is this?

226
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:14,792
Look, why did you do it?

227
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:18,838
You're in for property damage
and attempted aggravated assault.

228
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,799
Even first-time offenders serve time
for the latter.

229
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,468
You're a young person.
What are you going to do?

230
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:29,765
I'm a fan.

231
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,561
I like you very much.

232
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,230
Right.

233
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,775
That's why I did it,
because I like him too.

234
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:41,402
- What's that?
- Jeong-heon.

235
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:44,322
I only did it because I like you.

236
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:46,407
You see, I'm a fan of Jeong-heon's.

237
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:48,201
On Woo-ju, that damn girl!

238
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:52,496
She kicked you to the curb
for that Song Ki-baek or whatever.

239
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:55,249
It must've been so hard for you.

240
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:58,336
My God, look how gaunt you are!

241
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:05,509
I don't want you to be unhappy.

242
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:13,351
You shouldn't have settled
with her so easily.

243
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:15,102
She said she was sorry.

244
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:19,565
It was a difficult situation
because she's a fan. Thank you.

245
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:22,777
Not at all. No one got hurt,
and she's going to pay for the window.

246
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:23,986
You can go.

247
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:29,116
- Jeong-heon, are you all right?
- Huh? Yeah.

248
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:30,534
Let's go.

249
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,623
Ki-baek, you should take Woo-ju home.

250
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,375
- Yeah.
- I'll see you.

251
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:40,294
Jeong-heon.

252
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:43,881
Get home safely.

253
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,133
Take care of her.

254
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:47,927
Sure.

255
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,265
Thank you.

256
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:01,482
Jeong-heon.

257
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,653
You've dealt with crazy fans before.

258
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,073
Jeong-heon.

259
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:12,118
She likes me so much that...

260
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:16,163
she wanted to kill someone.

261
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,583
And I make a living out
of people like that.

262
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,255
I'm so sick and tired of it.

263
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:28,050
Of course, you are.
That girl looked totally insane.

264
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:31,512
No, I'm sick of myself.

265
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:38,561
I couldn't even say anything to her.

266
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:41,605
I just waited for the lawyer
to come and speak for me,

267
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:44,900
and I was relieved
when Woo-ju said she'd settle.

268
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:47,653
Jeong-heon.

269
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:50,197
Can I call myself successful?

270
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:07,840
I told you. I'm really okay.

271
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,679
You know I'd tell you if I weren't.

272
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:16,766
I'm not okay with this.

273
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,604
The threat was real this time.
You could've gotten hurt.

274
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:25,441
I am not okay with this at all.

275
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,784
Hi, this is Song Ki-baek.

276
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:38,954
I'll do the interview like you said.

277
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,790
Yes.

278
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:42,500
Thank you.

279
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,259
Even if it involves lying,

280
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:54,887
let's do everything we can.

281
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:18,661
{\an8}SONG KI-BAEK PRESS INTERVIEW
REFERENCE SHEET

282
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm glad you changed your mind
about the interview.

283
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:28,462
This is the only way
to solve the situation.

284
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:32,049
Tell them nothing's going on
between you and Woo-ju.

285
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,718
Okay.

286
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:38,305
They're all reporters I know very well.
You can relax.

287
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:46,188
Can you smile for me?

288
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,691
Yes, good. All right.

289
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:53,028
You went from being an announcer
who only spoke the truth

290
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:56,657
to launching your freelance career
and excelling in variety shows.

291
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:58,117
"Honest and sincere."

292
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,995
Those are perfect key words
to describe your character.

293
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:05,457
Thank you. Since my days as
an announcer, sincerity and truthfulness--

294
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:11,755
I'm sorry.

295
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:17,094
Sincerity and truthfulness have
always been the only values I pursued.

296
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:20,389
Speaking of sincerity and truthfulness,

297
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:22,808
you've been receiving
a lot of attention, Ki-baek.

298
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:25,895
<i>Couple's Paradise</i> is hot right now.

299
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:27,479
Yes.

300
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,691
When you and Ms. Min Cho-hui
became a couple in the end,

301
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:32,902
your fans were very excited.

302
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:36,989
But it doesn't seem like you guys
have been doing well since then.

303
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:41,285
Oh, that's not really true.

304
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,288
If it's not true,

305
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,249
are you saying there has been
a misunderstanding?

306
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,793
That's right.

307
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:54,089
Cho-hui caused
a misunderstanding and left town.

308
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:57,051
If I could,
I'd fly over to Paris and just...

309
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:04,266
That's funny.

310
00:25:09,563 --> 00:25:12,983
This is not what I wanted to tell you.

311
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,822
You can relax. I'm sure you have
your own side of the story.

312
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:20,282
Please take your time.

313
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:21,283
Okay.

314
00:25:22,117 --> 00:25:23,285
Take my time

315
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:25,788
and relax.

316
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,085
No one cares about details.
Everyone just believes Cho-hui

317
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:33,337
and is throwing stones at me.
Isn't that wrong?

318
00:25:33,337 --> 00:25:35,422
No one's listening to what I have to say.

319
00:25:35,422 --> 00:25:38,676
Okay, so are you saying that
Ms. Min Cho-hui told lies?

320
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:40,678
They are lies. Well, not all of them.

321
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:42,763
What exactly is a lie and what isn't?

322
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:45,307
I'll tell you
if you'll write about it honestly.

323
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:47,226
- Are you and Ms. On Woo-ju together?
- Yes!

324
00:25:48,143 --> 00:25:49,561
- What?
- Oh, my God.

325
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,563
You're together? This is a huge scoop!

326
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:53,399
- Mr. An, let's take a break.
- Everyone.

327
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:54,984
Let's take a short break--

328
00:25:54,984 --> 00:25:56,777
A break? We only have an hour.

329
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:59,154
If you and Woo-ju are in fact together...

330
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:02,366
That's not what you're supposed to say.
Get it together, okay?

331
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:04,702
- If it's not true, please explain.
- That's a lie!

332
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:07,288
- Do you have any proof to back it up?
- Well--

333
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:10,374
Why reveal this now
when it could escalate things?

334
00:26:10,374 --> 00:26:12,710
- That's...
- We'll wrap things up here.

335
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,628
- Thanks.
- But this will make a good story.

336
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:15,963
Wait, Ki-baek.

337
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:21,218
Wait.

338
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:41,113
I'm sorry.
I have something I must tell you.

339
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:42,906
You're On Woo-ju, aren't you?

340
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:46,452
What is the matter with you two?
Are you insane?

341
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:49,580
Everything Min Cho-hui said
in her video is a lie.

342
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:54,793
It wasn't me who drove off Yu-yeong.
It was Cho-hui.

343
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:05,137
In here, I have a video that proves
Cho-hui was blackmailing Yu-yeong.

344
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,769
<i>He said I-su has a picture of you two
as his phone wallpaper</i>

345
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:13,771
<i>and told him you're his girlfriend.</i>

346
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:15,773
<i>Cho-hui. Please keep it a secret.</i>

347
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:17,232
<i>I can't.</i>

348
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:19,193
<i>What do you want, then?</i>

349
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:21,445
<i>Get lost. Drop out of the show.</i>

350
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:23,947
If you don't,

351
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:27,910
you're screwed. I'll go public with it.

352
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,538
<i>One of the fixed cameras on set
caught their voices.</i>

353
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:35,376
<i>The editors missed it
because no one was in the shot.</i>

354
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:37,127
<i>I need Song Ki-baek.</i>

355
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:39,797
<i>With Kim Jeong-heon,
things may not go how I want.</i>

356
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:43,258
- Did you meet with her?
- <i>She's right here with me.</i>

357
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:51,850
And I've brought a witness.

358
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:57,606
Hello.

359
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:59,858
Yu-yeong can join the interview.

360
00:28:02,653 --> 00:28:05,114
Ki-baek. Are you okay?

361
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,326
What about your relationship
with each other?

362
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:14,289
It's true.

363
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:16,667
I really like her!

364
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:20,754
I wasn't going to tell you,
but it's true, and I can't deny--

365
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:21,964
Yes, we're together.

366
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:26,343
Wow, this is incredible.

367
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,011
Oh, my God.

368
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,015
But it's not true that
we were dating before the show

369
00:28:32,015 --> 00:28:33,642
for some sort of personal gain.

370
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:36,895
Right. It was when we were
finished with the show

371
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:39,481
that I asked her out.

372
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:49,366
I know you may or may not believe
what we tell you.

373
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:52,202
- But the two of us--
- We will not lie anymore.

374
00:28:57,624 --> 00:29:01,837
On Woo-ju and Song Ki-baek are a couple!

375
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:04,423
- Wow, this is...
- This is a huge scoop!

376
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:07,301
Man, what a scoop.

377
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:10,053
Wow, this is totally...

378
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:11,138
WE ARE A COUPLE

379
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,986
HAIL TO ALL COUPLES!
THE TRUTH OF PARADISE

380
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:52,095
They call you the Hooray Couple.

381
00:29:53,472 --> 00:29:54,681
The comments are...

382
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:57,351
Half critical, half caring.
Everything is half and half.

383
00:29:57,351 --> 00:29:58,936
That's true, but...

384
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,648
- Kim Myeong-ji did drugs?
- Really?

385
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:04,525
He named 12 accomplices,

386
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:06,944
including politicians and celebrities.
That's crazy.

387
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:09,530
Wow. I never thought
he'd do something like that.

388
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,323
- I know.
- Wait.

389
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:15,285
Does that mean this whole thing
about Ki-baek has blown over?

390
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:17,287
That's great, isn't it?

391
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:20,082
Ki-baek and Woo-ju are
already yesterday's news.

392
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:29,091
That looks nice.

393
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:32,553
GOLD RESORT
EXCLUSIVE LIMITED-TIME OFFER

394
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:34,972
Maybe we should all take a trip there.

395
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:37,015
Like we can afford it.

396
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,269
We've never taken a trip together,
all five of us.

397
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:48,527
{\an8}WEIGH TO GO GYM

398
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:54,575
LUNGE, OVERHEAD DUMBBELL PRESS

399
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:58,287
WIDE SQUAT

400
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:06,295
Captain, are you lifting
enough weights at home?

401
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:12,509
- Wow.
- Think about me while you do it.

402
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:16,054
Should I come back
for another workout this evening?

403
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:18,891
I have some training sessions
scheduled this evening.

404
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:19,933
I see.

405
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,604
Come later at night.

406
00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:25,898
Okay.

407
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,191
I ran into Gu-won a few days ago.

408
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:29,109
Really?

409
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:32,321
How come he doesn't like fried chicken?
That's unusual.

410
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,699
Gu-won does like fried chicken.
He loves it.

411
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:36,950
What?

412
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:40,287
His drone was stuck in a tree,
so I helped him get it out.

413
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:42,164
Didn't he tell you?

414
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,374
He didn't.

415
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:46,960
That's weird.

416
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,671
Gu-won tells me everything,

417
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:52,799
even little things like
how his shoelaces came undone.

418
00:31:57,137 --> 00:31:58,263
Let's just work out.

419
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:14,780
What if someone sees us?

420
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,908
So what? We're the Hooray Couple.
The whole world knows.

421
00:32:17,908 --> 00:32:21,328
I don't know if it's good or bad,
but people don't seem too interested.

422
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:26,917
Yesterday, I thought all those people
were going to bite us to death.

423
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:30,087
They have so many other things
to bite in here.

424
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:33,966
Thank you.

425
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:36,510
For not making me lie.

426
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:39,930
I'm sorry I pressured you into lying.

427
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:47,562
What happened to your switch yesterday?
You said you didn't sneeze.

428
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:54,611
Try lying about anything.

429
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:59,199
Here. "On Woo-ju and Song Ki-baek
are not a couple."

430
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,160
On Woo-ju and Song Ki-baek...

431
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:04,997
are a couple.

432
00:33:04,997 --> 00:33:06,039
What?

433
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,207
We definitely are.

434
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:09,459
Come on, I'm not joking.

435
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:12,462
Try it. "Song Ki-baek is a woman."

436
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:15,048
Song Ki-baek...

437
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:19,803
is a man.

438
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:22,014
Why?

439
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:24,391
I mean, why isn't it working?

440
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:29,771
Do you feel the same?

441
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,867
The switch is gone.

442
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:45,746
Now, lightning will strike all the time.

443
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:48,749
Oh, lightning will strike?

444
00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:51,835
It may seem like the recent incident
has been resolved somehow,

445
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:54,755
but I don't know what mistakes
I'll make in the future

446
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:56,965
and who I might end up hurting.

447
00:33:57,924 --> 00:33:59,426
In the future?

448
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:02,220
Even the switch is gone now.

449
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,015
There is no one
who can put the brakes on me.

450
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:10,020
The people I like,
the people I love, my family...

451
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:12,439
I'll be causing trouble for them.

452
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:14,733
No, I already am.

453
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:16,359
It must've been really hard.

454
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,696
For everyone you love,
including your family.

455
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:21,740
Yeah.

456
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:24,409
- And?
- Sorry?

457
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:28,163
So what did you do for them after that?

458
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,832
I didn't exactly do anything.

459
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:39,591
"Oh, I'm going to be struck by lightning."

460
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:44,763
- Can anyone anticipate that?
- No.

461
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:47,599
Can anyone avoid lightning
because they plan to?

462
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:49,351
You can't.

463
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:52,270
So what are you worried about?
There's nothing you can do.

464
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:58,944
The future comes after the present.

465
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:01,988
Find something you can do in the present.

466
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,408
-"The future comes after the present."
- After.

467
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:07,702
-"Something I can do in the present."
- Find it.

468
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:09,121
Okay.

469
00:35:11,915 --> 00:35:12,749
Oh, right.

470
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:17,629
This was struck by lightning too.
It's called <i>byeokjomok</i>.

471
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:20,841
<i>Byeokjomok</i>?

472
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:33,019
SU TAEKWONDO

473
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:37,440
Hello.

474
00:35:39,276 --> 00:35:40,318
Mom!

475
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:42,779
- Mom!
- Mom!

476
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:45,866
Master, my mom is here.

477
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:47,534
- Hello.
- How are you?

478
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:49,077
- Great.
- Hey, this is my mom.

479
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:51,788
My mom works at a TV station.

480
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:54,207
- Take care.
- You too. Bye.

481
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,835
- Let's go, shall we?
- Yeah.

482
00:35:57,752 --> 00:35:59,087
Are you not busy today?

483
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:02,591
No, I'm not busy.
Want to go eat something delicious?

484
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:03,508
Yeah.

485
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:07,179
Mom, in Korean class today,

486
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:10,682
I-jun cried about getting
a 90 on his dictation quiz.

487
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:13,393
I got a 50, but I didn't cry.

488
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:14,769
That's my boy.

489
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:16,563
- Don't eat too fast.
- Okay.

490
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:24,529
<i>Would it upset him
if I asked him about Un-baek?</i>

491
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:27,991
What?

492
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:29,784
Do you want water?

493
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,661
Does Un-baek like you?

494
00:36:38,835 --> 00:36:40,253
I think so.

495
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:42,881
Do you like him too?

496
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:45,467
I think so.

497
00:36:47,344 --> 00:36:48,803
I like you too, Mom.

498
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:52,807
I like you very much too, Gu-won.

499
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:54,851
But you're busy.

500
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,398
I only get a little time with you,

501
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:05,487
but this means
now I have to share it with him.

502
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:08,782
Gu-won.

503
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:11,493
No. I don't want to do that.

504
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,329
I don't want to share.

505
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:17,540
I'm sorry, Gu-won.

506
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:20,627
I didn't know...

507
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:24,047
that's how you felt.

508
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,465
Why didn't you know?

509
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:28,593
I can hear all your thoughts,

510
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:33,598
so how come you never know how I feel?

511
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:53,410
CAPTAIN

512
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,247
She won't text me back or come to the gym.

513
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:29,321
Honey, did you pack the samples?
We're going to the morning class.

514
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:32,324
Of course. And I set one aside
for Ms. Park, the singing teacher.

515
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:35,410
For God's sake.

516
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:39,831
It's inside out! Seriously.

517
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:43,626
Would it kill you to put it in the hamper?

518
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:47,255
- Mom, did you wash my sneakers?
- I'm busy, okay?

519
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:49,716
- Wash your own sneakers.
- Why didn't you tell me?

520
00:38:49,716 --> 00:38:52,093
I could've taken them to the cleaners.

521
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:55,013
That's a waste of money.
Leave them! I'll do it tomorrow.

522
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:58,475
Mom, we got the eggs
and rice delivered from the grocery store.

523
00:38:58,475 --> 00:38:59,851
I ate some of the eggs.

524
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:02,020
I ordered them to make <i>jangjorim</i>.

525
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,731
How many?
Don't tell me you ate half already.

526
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:07,650
You're making <i>jangjorim</i>?
Sounds good. Should I boil the eggs?

527
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,195
- You're going to crack them all--
- Listen.

528
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:12,238
Yes, Ki-baek. What is it?

529
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:16,034
Maybe we should take a family trip.

530
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:18,661
Huh? Trip? Where?

531
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:22,749
We can't afford a trip abroad.
How about the Gold Resort down south?

532
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:25,251
The Gold Resort? The one we saw earlier?

533
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:28,671
The place that costs
one million won a night?

534
00:39:28,671 --> 00:39:32,258
Are you insane?
One million per night? Are you kidding?

535
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,593
- Let's go!
- Zip it!

536
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:38,014
Ki-baek. You can't squander the money
you worked so hard to make.

537
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:40,934
Ki-baek, I appreciate the gesture.

538
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,270
I've already made a reservation,
so let's go.

539
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,147
Cancel it. I'm not going.

540
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:49,734
- Mom.
- Mom! Come on!

541
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:52,404
When would we ever get to stay
at the Gold Resort?

542
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,465
What's up with Gu-won?
Did he and Yeon fight?

543
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:15,051
Don't know.
Yeon said she'd pick him up later.

544
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:17,303
It's the same for me and her.

545
00:40:18,972 --> 00:40:20,723
Our kids are the source of our worries.

546
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:24,477
Didn't you say I was what you live for?
That's hurtful.

547
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,066
You are what I live for. I could never
leave behind a daughter like you.

548
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:31,734
I'll make you worry forever.

549
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:32,777
Good grief.

550
00:40:34,404 --> 00:40:35,488
What a good daughter.

551
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:39,534
Here.

552
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:41,995
What's this?

553
00:40:41,995 --> 00:40:44,247
The number of my most frequent customer.

554
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:47,876
She's been coloring and bleaching her hair

555
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:51,588
without realizing her hair has become
as ragged as corn silk.

556
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:54,090
She just asks for
whatever takes a long time.

557
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:56,843
When she comes, she stays all day long.

558
00:40:58,845 --> 00:41:01,473
But she said she'd be going
somewhere far soon.

559
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:05,602
She won't be back for a long time.

560
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:11,107
So she won't be back.
Why did you ask for her number?

561
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:15,236
I'm fine because I have a daughter
I'll forever have to worry about.

562
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:17,655
Do whatever makes you feel better.

563
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,947
Did you see Dr. Kim?

564
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:00,532
- Yes.
- What did he say?

565
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:03,409
Well, things that you would expect.

566
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:07,956
So, Woo-ju.
What's troubling you so much this time

567
00:42:07,956 --> 00:42:09,958
that you had to do all this laundry?

568
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:17,090
Oh, it's my birth mom's phone number.

569
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:21,970
Let me go get laundry too. I've got tons.

570
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,471
No, I'm tired.

571
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,473
Come sit down.

572
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:44,367
Do I feel this way because I'm angry?

573
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:46,661
Maybe.

574
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:50,498
But I barely remember her.
There's nothing to be angry about.

575
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:52,584
Yeah?

576
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:54,877
Am I just curious why she did it?

577
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,546
Maybe.

578
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:59,257
But what's the point?
It's all in the past.

579
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:02,385
- I'm happy with my life now.
- Then that's all that matters.

580
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,181
You're giving me half-hearted answers
because it's not your business.

581
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:11,853
Of course not. I'm concentrating
all my energy on my shoulder right now.

582
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:16,691
I don't know

583
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:22,780
why my heart feels so heavy.

584
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:30,788
If you let this pass,
it will eventually become nothing.

585
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:36,628
If you meet with her,
you may be able to find out

586
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:39,422
why your heart feels so heavy.

587
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:45,887
Whichever you choose,
I support you one hundred percent.

588
00:43:50,016 --> 00:43:52,018
It's heavy. Move your head.

589
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,944
YOON JI-HU:
I QUIT MY JOB

590
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:05,323
Oh no, you'd better go.

591
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:09,702
No, it can wait.
It's not like it isn't a big deal.

592
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:15,667
Come on, you should go.

593
00:44:17,669 --> 00:44:19,837
This is more important to me.

594
00:44:27,595 --> 00:44:29,889
Are you crazy? You quit your job?

595
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:34,352
Hey, why are you yelling? You scared me.

596
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:38,564
Dad, Uncle Ki-baek, have this too.

597
00:44:39,148 --> 00:44:42,777
- Wow, this is delicious-looking plastic.
- God.

598
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:46,280
Wow, it's good. You're the best, Sol.

599
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,910
As you know,

600
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:56,666
my wife quit her job a long time ago
to take care of Sol at the hospital,

601
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:59,168
and I can't afford her medical bills
with my pay.

602
00:44:59,168 --> 00:45:02,422
So why did you quit?
How are you going to make money?

603
00:45:02,422 --> 00:45:03,881
I should make money.

604
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:07,176
I have to make way more than I did.
That's why I went freelance.

605
00:45:07,176 --> 00:45:10,346
Didn't you see what happened to me?
You could go broke.

606
00:45:10,346 --> 00:45:12,890
You're the reason why I did it.
I can do it too.

607
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,393
Ji-hu, this is a terrible idea!

608
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:20,148
I'm willing to do anything.

609
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,318
So Ki-baek, I need you to help me.

610
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:31,117
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I've got nothing,

611
00:45:31,993 --> 00:45:34,745
and I can't think about that right now.
I'm sorry.

612
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,499
Dad, I want to play in the ball pit.

613
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,627
- Go ahead, Sol. I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

614
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:45,089
Ki-baek.

615
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,216
Come with me to the mountains.

616
00:45:47,842 --> 00:45:49,343
Mountains? Why?

617
00:45:50,136 --> 00:45:51,012
Don't tell me...

618
00:45:53,222 --> 00:45:54,682
I can't. I don't want to.

619
00:45:54,682 --> 00:45:56,767
Do you want to see me go down?

620
00:45:57,393 --> 00:46:01,898
If I join you, I'll make things worse.
Please believe me, okay?

621
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:02,982
Hey.

622
00:46:04,066 --> 00:46:06,986
- Help me out.
- Oh, for God's sake.

623
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:13,326
Cancel all the high-profile jobs.

624
00:46:13,326 --> 00:46:15,161
And find another studio.

625
00:46:16,037 --> 00:46:17,121
Here he comes.

626
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:19,790
- I'm a fan. Could I have his autograph?
- I'm sorry.

627
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,461
- Can we please take a picture with him?
- I'm sorry. We're busy right now.

628
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:24,629
Come on, Jeong-heon.

629
00:46:24,629 --> 00:46:26,839
It's not like
we're asking for a big favor.

630
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:28,257
I know, right?

631
00:46:29,008 --> 00:46:31,802
- I just wanted a picture.
- I'll do it.

632
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:33,012
- What?
- Really?

633
00:46:33,596 --> 00:46:35,306
Wow, I can't believe this.

634
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,100
Could you take a picture with us too?

635
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:40,102
One, two, three.

636
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:43,856
- Wow, thank you!
- Thank you.

637
00:46:54,784 --> 00:46:56,118
Smoke with the window closed.

638
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:57,453
Mr. Kang.

639
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:04,126
I'm trying to catch a breath,
not suffocate to death.

640
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:06,671
You're part of
that public health campaign.

641
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:15,137
Should I just retire?

642
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,278
- We're going on a trip, not moving.
- Are we leaving now?

643
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:32,113
You can have the ends.

644
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:33,739
Why? These are for us anyway.

645
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:35,533
They're not for us.

646
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:38,536
What then?
Are you going to sell them on the highway?

647
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:39,745
Seriously.

648
00:47:40,663 --> 00:47:44,000
I'll have to join you tomorrow morning.
I have a gig.

649
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,126
I know.

650
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:48,462
I have a meeting too,
so we're heading out after lunch.

651
00:47:48,462 --> 00:47:50,965
Don't worry and take your time.

652
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:52,258
Drive safely.

653
00:47:52,258 --> 00:47:54,844
I'm sorry I can't come with you today.

654
00:47:57,471 --> 00:48:00,558
He has to keep himself apart
when he suggested the trip.

655
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:07,648
Listen. You can use this
when you guys eat or something.

656
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:09,775
- I can pay for our meals.
- Wow.

657
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:11,277
I'll just hold on to it.

658
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:13,863
No need. I've packed everything we need.

659
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:24,832
LIFE IN THE MOUNTAINS

660
00:48:24,832 --> 00:48:29,045
Your mother is very generous.
And a good cook.

661
00:48:29,045 --> 00:48:31,589
Thanks to her, we saved money on food.
Thank you.

662
00:48:32,298 --> 00:48:33,966
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

663
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:35,968
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

664
00:48:35,968 --> 00:48:37,386
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

665
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:39,889
It had to be so much work
for your mom to make all this.

666
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:42,642
By the way,
there are no cucumbers in her <i>gimbap</i>.

667
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:45,394
Oh, you're right.

668
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:47,146
He doesn't eat cucumbers. Right?

669
00:48:47,813 --> 00:48:48,689
Right.

670
00:49:09,293 --> 00:49:11,921
- Hey, careful.
- What are you doing? Gross.

671
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:13,631
You're a big star.

672
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:16,092
I can't roll out the red carpet,
but I can do this.

673
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:19,679
So we're just staying
at their home for a night?

674
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,932
"A night in the woods
with innocent real-life mountain people."

675
00:49:22,932 --> 00:49:24,308
That's our theme.

676
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:28,104
I'm counting on you. You're the closest
to a star among the three of us.

677
00:49:28,104 --> 00:49:29,021
- Three?
- Yeah.

678
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:32,233
He said he had a gig in the morning
and would join us after.

679
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:36,487
Hello, guys!

680
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:41,242
<i>Park Jin-bok!</i>

681
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:44,912
<i>After you guys fought, he faced
serious backlash and hit rock bottom.</i>

682
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:47,665
He got kicked out of his group
and took a break.

683
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:48,999
Now he's a trot singer.

684
00:49:50,084 --> 00:49:51,127
Jin-bok!

685
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:59,510
- Ki-baek, it's been a long time.
- Hi.

686
00:50:00,553 --> 00:50:05,975
<i>Last year's PN has returned as Jin-bok</i>

687
00:50:05,975 --> 00:50:09,186
<i>Your best lucky charm, Park Jin-bok</i>

688
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:13,023
- Wow, that was good.
- Great. Our lucky charm is here.

689
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:15,568
Let's go up
to the mountain dweller's home.

690
00:50:15,568 --> 00:50:16,944
Okay, let's go!

691
00:50:16,944 --> 00:50:18,654
<i>Jin-bok is as cute as...</i>

692
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:22,950
Be careful. He had a tough time,
and now he's all hyper on his gigs.

693
00:50:24,076 --> 00:50:25,411
- <i>He climbs the mountain--</i>
- Jin-bok.

694
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:28,205
Wrong way.
Please change your clothes first.

695
00:50:28,205 --> 00:50:29,582
Okey dokey!

696
00:50:29,582 --> 00:50:33,502
<i>He climbs the mountain with light steps
And his voice...</i>

697
00:50:33,502 --> 00:50:34,795
Dude, he scares me.

698
00:50:34,795 --> 00:50:37,548
That's what we're supposed to do.

699
00:50:58,652 --> 00:51:02,573
It's so white it's going to get dirty
with the smallest amount of work.

700
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:04,867
This is the uniform
of <i>Life in the Mountains</i>.

701
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:06,827
So it's intentional.

702
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:09,872
- All right, go ahead.
- Oh, okay.

703
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:13,793
Yeah.

704
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:20,216
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

705
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,806
THERAPEUTIC SOUNDS VOL. 2
SOUNDS OF NATURE

706
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:32,478
I always start my day listening to
the sounds of nature.

707
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,189
Wow.

708
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:36,774
I see.

709
00:51:38,192 --> 00:51:39,026
He scared me.

710
00:51:43,656 --> 00:51:46,450
The water deer eat all my potatoes.

711
00:51:47,535 --> 00:51:49,203
Stop eating my damn food!

712
00:51:50,246 --> 00:51:52,414
But aren't water deer active at night?

713
00:51:52,414 --> 00:51:53,666
Hey.

714
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:55,251
Whether you're human or an animal,

715
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:58,212
when you're starving,
you don't care if it's lunch or dinner.

716
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,181
Hey. Water deer sound scary.

717
00:52:09,682 --> 00:52:12,268
All right. We should probably eat first.

718
00:52:12,268 --> 00:52:13,269
- Yes.
- Sure.

719
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:15,521
I already have the main dish prepared.

720
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:18,399
Tall guy, can you go get eggs
from the chicken coop?

721
00:52:18,399 --> 00:52:22,027
The two of you, please pick some greens
from the hill behind the house.

722
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,322
Get a move on.

723
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:34,957
You're rather quiet.

724
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:39,712
What? Me? I guess I am.

725
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:41,839
Still, I hope this won't be boring.

726
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:44,842
Yes, right...

727
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,818
Hens with healthy ovaries start laying
eggs around 18 to 20 weeks of age,

728
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:05,279
producing approximately one egg per day.

729
00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:07,990
Wow, they clearly seem mature, don't they?

730
00:53:26,258 --> 00:53:28,093
I did it. I got one.

731
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:43,692
- I got two more!
- I knew he was the ace of the team.

732
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,235
Will we be able to air this?

733
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:47,905
He's swearing too much.
How can we edit it out?

734
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:52,743
Go away, you damn chickens!
I'm scared of chickens.

735
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:53,911
Look at him go.

736
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,580
That's how hard you have to try?
I had no idea.

737
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,459
Get away. I'm sorry.
You goddamn chickens. I only took four.

738
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:08,133
He said he was going to cook,
but he hasn't started a fire.

739
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,803
Maybe he doesn't need heat.
It could be a salad.

740
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:14,306
I have an electric cooktop in the kitchen.

741
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:17,142
If you need to use it,
make sure you use the right pot.

742
00:54:17,142 --> 00:54:20,604
- I thought you would use fire.
- You have to watch out for wildfires.

743
00:54:22,022 --> 00:54:23,482
Wow, is this chicken soup?

744
00:54:23,482 --> 00:54:26,860
Doesn't smell like chicken soup.
It smells familiar. What is it?

745
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:29,488
- Oh, curry!
- Ta-da.

746
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:35,077
Doesn't it look good?

747
00:54:35,577 --> 00:54:37,371
The best part of fish is the head.

748
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,207
The eyes are a real delicacy,
so help yourselves.

749
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:41,875
What's wrong?

750
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,169
Guys.

751
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,171
I'm going in first.

752
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:52,970
- Wow.
- Good, right?

753
00:54:58,976 --> 00:55:01,186
I just made this. Give it a taste.

754
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:12,072
I thought you'd be crushing the food,
but you're barely nibbling.

755
00:55:12,072 --> 00:55:14,783
He always eats slowly
and in small quantities.

756
00:55:15,534 --> 00:55:17,119
Really? That's a surprise.

757
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:19,747
I didn't mean it like that, Ji-hu.

758
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:23,083
It's okay. I know I look like
I'd eat a ton of food in no time.

759
00:55:24,126 --> 00:55:25,753
No, that's not true.

760
00:55:25,753 --> 00:55:28,922
When he first joined JBC,
he was thinner than me.

761
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:30,674
Really? Whoa.

762
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:34,595
If that's how you eat, what happened?
Is there a story?

763
00:55:35,804 --> 00:55:37,890
My daughter can't eat much food.

764
00:55:38,557 --> 00:55:41,977
And? Did you eat all the food
she didn't finish?

765
00:55:41,977 --> 00:55:44,188
She simply doesn't want to eat.

766
00:55:44,772 --> 00:55:47,983
Perhaps because she's been taking
so much strong medicine.

767
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:52,529
She has trouble digesting,
and she never has an appetite.

768
00:55:55,491 --> 00:56:00,287
But whenever she saw me eating,
she'd come and take a bite.

769
00:56:01,455 --> 00:56:05,292
So I started eating things
that I wanted her to eat.

770
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:09,004
Actually, this weight came from
all kinds of healthy food.

771
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:13,092
Hey, you're a good dad.

772
00:56:14,426 --> 00:56:18,430
Now I want to be a successful dad,
but it's challenging.

773
00:56:23,811 --> 00:56:24,645
Thank you.

774
00:56:28,148 --> 00:56:30,025
Was Mr. Shin okay with it?

775
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:32,444
It's all good.
He'll edit out the part about Sol.

776
00:56:32,444 --> 00:56:35,739
I actually think people
would like to hear about Sol.

777
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:38,659
It's nothing bad.
It made you look really warm-hearted.

778
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:41,954
That's just from our perspective.

779
00:56:42,454 --> 00:56:44,540
When Sol becomes a teenager,

780
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,167
she might not like that
I talked about her on TV.

781
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:51,922
When it comes to Sol,
he becomes unbelievably wise.

782
00:56:54,383 --> 00:56:56,969
Do you think
we're doing enough for the show?

783
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:59,471
Ki-baek in the chicken coop
was the only funny part.

784
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:00,722
You think so?

785
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:03,600
Speaking of which,
should we get in the water?

786
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,601
What?

787
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:07,020
There are two types of water
in variety shows.

788
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,398
Water to drink, water to jump into.

789
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:12,568
What? Wait, Ji-hu.
That's a little over-the-top.

790
00:57:16,822 --> 00:57:18,782
Mr. Shin! I'll go in.

791
00:57:19,533 --> 00:57:21,785
Where? What? Why?

792
00:57:21,785 --> 00:57:24,580
- Here.
- No, no. Don't do it.

793
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:27,207
Bad idea?

794
00:57:27,207 --> 00:57:29,376
Hey. No! Get back here.

795
00:57:30,502 --> 00:57:31,545
Don't do it.

796
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:38,260
No, you went in that chicken coop
with that face

797
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,095
and swore at those chickens!

798
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,890
- I have to try harder!
- Come here before I swear at you too!

799
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:44,016
Okay.

800
00:57:47,144 --> 00:57:48,854
Go into the water? Are you kidding?

801
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:54,234
Ki-baek, do you have
another job tomorrow morning?

802
00:57:54,234 --> 00:57:57,196
Oh, it's a family trip.

803
00:57:57,196 --> 00:58:00,407
Wow. You guys are family men.

804
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:04,661
This is actually my first time
taking a trip with my entire family.

805
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:06,955
Really? Your mom must be thrilled.

806
00:58:06,955 --> 00:58:09,833
She says it's a waste of money.
You know my mom.

807
00:58:11,293 --> 00:58:12,377
Mom!

808
00:58:12,377 --> 00:58:14,171
You look so nice today.

809
00:58:14,963 --> 00:58:16,006
God.

810
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:17,841
You said you didn't want to go.

811
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:19,551
Just put these in the car.

812
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:22,513
Oh, I forgot about this. My gosh.

813
00:58:23,514 --> 00:58:25,432
Hey, Yu-jeong.

814
00:58:25,432 --> 00:58:28,310
You look so beautiful today,
like Audrey Hepburn.

815
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,145
What? Oh, my goodness.

816
00:58:30,145 --> 00:58:32,272
Today isn't that big of a deal.

817
00:58:32,272 --> 00:58:36,193
It is a big deal. All five of us are
going on a trip for the first time.

818
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,153
Have fun.

819
00:58:39,446 --> 00:58:42,449
I'll drive. You couldn't sleep last night
because of your knee.

820
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:44,076
It's okay. I can do it.

821
00:58:44,076 --> 00:58:46,370
I'll do it. You can drive us home.

822
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,372
- See you.
- See you, guys.

823
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:02,636
YOUR BEAUTIFUL SKIN
ENTRUST IT TO CHAM BEAUTY

824
00:59:02,636 --> 00:59:05,264
All right! Let's go!
We're almost there, guys!

825
00:59:06,598 --> 00:59:07,766
Come on, let's go.

826
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,185
- We never get tired! Let's go!
- Let's go.

827
00:59:15,357 --> 00:59:16,358
Oh, man.

828
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:17,943
God, I'm exhausted.

829
00:59:18,777 --> 00:59:21,697
Mr. Shin, did you get some good scenes?

830
00:59:21,697 --> 00:59:23,407
Yeah. It was great.

831
00:59:24,658 --> 00:59:26,201
You looked like a sloth.

832
00:59:26,201 --> 00:59:27,369
- Really?
- Yeah.

833
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:29,955
I guess it was funny.

834
00:59:29,955 --> 00:59:32,207
- Let's take a short break, guys.
- Okay.

835
00:59:32,207 --> 00:59:34,585
This is what Mr. Mountain Man
was talking about.

836
00:59:35,168 --> 00:59:36,628
Wow, it looks amazing.

837
00:59:36,628 --> 00:59:38,922
He said it's a jujube tree
struck by lightning.

838
00:59:41,967 --> 00:59:44,970
This was struck by lightning too.

839
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:46,221
It's called <i>byeokjomok</i>.

840
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:48,849
Yeah, it's a <i>byeokjomok</i>.

841
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:50,892
It's a surprise no one has cut it down.

842
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:53,145
Huh? Why would anyone cut it down?

843
00:59:53,812 --> 00:59:56,857
This is the strongest wood in the world.

844
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:11,288
"A bolt from the blue has made me strong."

845
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:13,457
"I am no longer..."

846
01:00:13,457 --> 01:00:16,126
"I am no longer afraid
of unexpected storms."

847
01:00:16,126 --> 01:00:17,294
You scared me.

848
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:21,256
I wrote that. What do you think?

849
01:00:22,633 --> 01:00:25,177
- Isn't it awesome?
- It sounds familiar.

850
01:00:27,763 --> 01:00:28,722
You're right.

851
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:33,602
- It's something I read somewhere.
- Right? You got me.

852
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:36,563
There are so many trees here.

853
01:00:37,939 --> 01:00:39,816
You think it knew
it would be hit by lightning?

854
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,944
It's not like it could've run away
even if it knew.

855
01:00:42,944 --> 01:00:44,196
Right.

856
01:00:44,196 --> 01:00:47,199
Still, it was struck by lightning
and turned into Iron Man.

857
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:49,534
It worked out for the better.

858
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:54,748
After my business failed,

859
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:59,086
I moved here thinking everything was over.

860
01:01:00,128 --> 01:01:01,254
But somehow...

861
01:01:03,548 --> 01:01:04,883
I'm still alive and well.

862
01:01:14,184 --> 01:01:16,395
<i>You never know what will happen in life.</i>

863
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:20,565
I was worried sick
about Ki-baek for days, and now?

864
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:24,986
Goodness. I never thought I'd have
a stroke of good luck like this.

865
01:01:24,986 --> 01:01:26,697
This isn't a stroke of good luck.

866
01:01:26,697 --> 01:01:30,450
The universe is rewarding you
for your hard work for the last 30 years.

867
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:31,868
You think so?

868
01:01:33,495 --> 01:01:34,663
You're right.

869
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:39,418
Well, while I'm being rewarded,
I wish I'd get a vacation too.

870
01:01:39,418 --> 01:01:40,460
Of course.

871
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,463
Don't lift a finger when we get there.
We'll do everything.

872
01:01:43,463 --> 01:01:44,798
Really?

873
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:47,008
I'll cook.

874
01:01:47,008 --> 01:01:48,427
I'll do the dishes.

875
01:01:49,386 --> 01:01:50,637
I love you, Yu-jeong.

876
01:01:51,972 --> 01:01:52,973
Yeah, I love you too.

877
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:55,600
Boy, this is so exciting.

878
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,105
That's right! I should enjoy
some luxury for a change.

879
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:09,364
I got rid of everything.

880
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:15,036
I got rid of my phone, my TV,
and everything else when I moved here.

881
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:16,913
But in the end...

882
01:02:19,124 --> 01:02:20,417
I couldn't give up Wi-Fi.

883
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:23,128
I don't think you gave up a thing.

884
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:28,341
You don't have to give up everything
to live in the mountains.

885
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:32,387
Right? It's your life.
You can live it however you want.

886
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:36,933
Whether you're hit by lightning
or with a storm,

887
01:02:37,476 --> 01:02:39,686
you just fight hard to survive.

888
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:42,063
You know, there's a saying.

889
01:02:42,856 --> 01:02:46,359
"Don't be afraid of the storm
that can't be stopped."

890
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:49,863
"Learn how to dance in the rain instead."

891
01:02:51,948 --> 01:02:53,450
Should we dance, then?

892
01:02:54,326 --> 01:02:55,535
Let's do it.

893
01:02:55,535 --> 01:02:59,122
For the kind of storm we're weathering,
we've got to really shake it.

894
01:02:59,122 --> 01:03:00,874
Mr. Shin, I'm going to dance.

895
01:03:00,874 --> 01:03:02,125
Oh, sure.

896
01:03:02,918 --> 01:03:05,587
He's trying to get more screen time.
Aren't you tired?

897
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:06,797
No.

898
01:03:06,797 --> 01:03:08,548
You look like a dancing sloth.

899
01:03:08,548 --> 01:03:09,549
Really?

900
01:03:11,676 --> 01:03:13,011
Jin-bok, are you asleep?

901
01:03:13,011 --> 01:03:15,180
- Sing if you have nothing better to do.
- No.

902
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,182
Oh, I know you!

903
01:03:17,182 --> 01:03:20,143
- You're... PN!
- Yes.

904
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:21,812
Should I play the instrumental?

905
01:03:21,812 --> 01:03:23,647
No. He won an award for a song.

906
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,525
"Look At That." Sing that one.

907
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:36,660
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

908
01:03:38,787 --> 01:03:43,708
<i>I sit by the stream all alone</i>

909
01:03:46,294 --> 01:03:52,342
<i>When greens start to sprout</i>

910
01:03:54,177 --> 01:04:00,308
<i>And the spring breeze ruffles the water</i>

911
01:04:02,185 --> 01:04:04,437
<i>You said...</i>

912
01:04:10,485 --> 01:04:11,570
<i>My mom said this to me.</i>

913
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:19,536
<i>You made such a promise</i>

914
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:22,455
Are you that happy? You never sing.

915
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:25,333
What? Why can't I sing?

916
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:26,668
<i>Endlessly</i>

917
01:04:26,668 --> 01:04:28,879
- I'm just saying you're really good.
- What?

918
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,047
Really?

919
01:04:32,257 --> 01:04:35,010
Don't tease me.
I'm going to take singing lessons.

920
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,094
Sure.

921
01:04:37,429 --> 01:04:41,683
<i>She said that because
good fortune is too far away from us,</i>

922
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:44,936
<i>we shouldn't dream about catching it.</i>

923
01:05:00,535 --> 01:05:02,329
Wish we had more of your mom's <i>gimbap</i>.

924
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:03,747
Yeah, me too.

925
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:09,210
<i>And we can't do anything
about the misfortune</i>

926
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,338
<i>that blindsides us.</i>

927
01:05:13,173 --> 01:05:15,634
<i>All we can do is just accept it.</i>

928
01:05:18,678 --> 01:05:20,639
<i>But life goes on.</i>

929
01:05:22,223 --> 01:05:24,684
<i>Life is just about living each day.</i>

930
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,864
<i>That's how you live your life.</i>

931
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,725
