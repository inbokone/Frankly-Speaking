00:00:49,258 --> 00:01:00,024
FRANKLY SPEAKING 💞 @ kissasian.one

2
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:08,857
Yeah, pretty.

3
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:07,124
{\an8}Well...

4
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,627
{\an8}- Well, I--
- We should go home now.

5
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,422
{\an8}Oh, yes.

6
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:29,605
{\an8}Oh, right.

7
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:39,198
EPISODE 8:
STARTING TODAY, WE ARE...

8
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,458
<i>I just hit 20,000 followers.</i>

9
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,168
<i>Want to celebrate at my restaurant?</i>

10
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:53,545
<i>Congrats, but I have
back-to-back client meetings.</i>

11
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:56,673
<i>Poor Ki-baek. The pool fight
and his self-intro were hilarious.</i>

12
00:02:56,673 --> 00:02:59,635
<i>I've seen tons of memes of Ki-baek
and Jeong-heon rolling around.</i>

13
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:00,552
I SAW THEM TOO

14
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:03,096
<i>It will create more buzz
once Woo-ju shows up next week.</i>

15
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,144
Is she still asleep?

16
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:11,855
Why isn't she saying anything?

17
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:27,287
STILL ASLEEP?

18
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,215
GOOD MORNING

19
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:39,299
Damn.

20
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,096
WANT TO JOIN ME FOR BREAKFAST?

21
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:54,666
Ki-baek, are you up?

22
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,003
Yes. I'm up.

23
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:27,991
They'll start sprouting soon.
We've got to eat them before they do.

24
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:30,452
I told you we should get just one box.

25
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:33,330
The grocery store owner always buys
three sets of lotion from me,

26
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,832
so how could I buy just one box?

27
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,584
Lotion and potatoes aren't the same.

28
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:39,586
Lotion doesn't go bad for years.

29
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:42,631
Hey, Ki-baek. <i>Couple's Paradise</i>, huh?

30
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:44,549
What? Is his show getting popular?

31
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:46,843
It's being hashtagged a lot.

32
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:47,844
You're on Instagram?

33
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:51,848
- Just peel the potatoes.
- Is Ki-baek going to be a star?

34
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:53,141
I love you so much, bro.

35
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,646
Ki-baek, get a plate
and put about five of these on it.

36
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:04,111
Ms. On, would you like
some potato pancakes?

37
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:06,947
I can smell them
from all the way down here.

38
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:09,157
I'd be disappointed if I didn't get one!

39
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,036
Take this too.

40
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,517
Are you trying to break the door?

41
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:37,269
Jesus.

42
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:39,938
- Thank you.
- Sure.

43
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:44,067
Gosh, look at all these potato pancakes.
Thank you.

44
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:16,224
I feel a lot better throughout the day
when I do my morning stretches.

45
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:20,061
I... I was having my morning coffee.

46
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:21,938
Would you like some? Just a minute.

47
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:23,607
It's okay. I already had some.

48
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:34,701
- You've got something on--
- What?

49
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:48,298
Oh, I don't--
I don't know what it could be.

50
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,841
You're good now.

51
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,138
- Starting today, we--
- Last night--

52
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,307
- It was nice.
- We're cool.

53
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,310
Yes.

54
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:10,529
The show has premiered,
but nothing is really different.

55
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:11,780
It's quiet.

56
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:15,825
It just premiered. Did you think
you were going to be a star overnight?

57
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:17,118
I didn't mean it like that.

58
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,248
What are you doing today?

59
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:23,542
Nothing. What about you?

60
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,585
I'm busy.

61
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:29,089
I'm working on another show
to fill in for someone,

62
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:32,050
and I think I'll drop by
the staff meeting while I'm out.

63
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:34,803
Good for you.

64
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,977
Jobs will come to those
who wait patiently.

65
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:48,024
What a cheerful way to tell someone
with impulse control issues

66
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,610
to be patient.

67
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,161
Ki-baek,

68
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:04,958
I hope you'll be yourself from now on.
Honest and unpretentious.

69
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,295
It's really cute when you do that.

70
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,383
It's cute-- Dad.

71
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,094
Oh, hello.

72
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:19,097
Boy, my shoulders.
Maybe the stretches were...

73
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,483
Let's go.

74
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:36,573
{\an8}TEMPORARILY CLOSED
WEIGH TO GO GYM

75
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,411
{\an8}WEIGH TO GO GYM

76
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:43,038
{\an8}<i>Yes, I just wired you the rent.</i>

77
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,915
Yes. I won't be late again.

78
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:48,001
I'm going to do my best! Okay, bye.

79
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:52,088
All right.

80
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:55,800
YOU CAN DO IT!

81
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,885
What's this?

82
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,308
CHAE YEON

83
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,686
Un-baek.

84
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:11,191
You wouldn't be able to handle it.

85
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,944
There we go.

86
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,743
"No more bites, no more excuses."

87
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:28,124
Excuse me.

88
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:32,545
1:1 PROFESSIONAL TRAINING

89
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:38,218
I thought I should start working out.

90
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:39,886
I see.

91
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:41,721
Okay.

92
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:50,021
Hello.

93
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:51,314
- Hi.
- Hello.

94
00:10:53,775 --> 00:11:00,824
COUPLE'S PARADISE
AUGUST 16

95
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:03,576
Hello.

96
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:07,997
I JUST HAD LUNCH
DON'T SKIP ANY MEALS

97
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:10,333
THANKS, I WON'T! KI-BAEK--

98
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,251
Oh, Ms. On.

99
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,628
Oh! Mr. Jang, hello.

100
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,714
I heard. You hit it big this time.

101
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,966
Not yet, but I hope I do.

102
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,136
- Did you change your number?
- No. Give me a call sometime.

103
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:24,723
Of course. I should cast you
before you become a star.

104
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:27,434
I didn't know you wanted
to be in front of the camera.

105
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,728
- I'll call you.
- Yes, please do.

106
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:32,313
Bye.

107
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:43,158
Hey, your show is creating quite the buzz.

108
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:45,577
I could feel it at the preview.

109
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:49,372
You were mad at us
for spending too much money.

110
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:52,125
How's the editing going?
I appreciate your hard work.

111
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:55,628
Huh? Chief, you're here too.

112
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:58,590
It's been a while, Woo-ju.

113
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,051
- Did you catch our show's premiere?
- Of course. I was just talking about it.

114
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,761
You must've worked really hard.

115
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:07,098
You make your first appearance
at the end of the next episode.

116
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:10,018
Wow, you might become famous.

117
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:11,227
Come on.

118
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:14,522
Good luck until the end. Let's go!

119
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:15,940
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

120
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:19,277
But Woo-ju,

121
00:12:19,944 --> 00:12:21,863
you shouldn't come here
for the time being.

122
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:26,284
You said you wouldn't be involved
in the production.

123
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:28,870
What if someone sees you here
and takes issue with it?

124
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,164
Right.

125
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:33,750
I asked her to come.

126
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,711
If the show does well,
we'll have to discuss Woo-ju's role.

127
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:39,005
It isn't your team's place
to discuss her role.

128
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:44,427
If you want the series to continue,
step up the promotion game.

129
00:12:44,427 --> 00:12:46,137
Your ratings need to go up.

130
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,264
Yes, ma'am. We'll do our best.

131
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:49,891
- Have you got a latte?
- Here.

132
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:53,686
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

133
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:54,896
- Take care now.
- Bye.

134
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:59,150
I'm sorry I barged in.

135
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,569
Since the show premiered,
I wanted to show support.

136
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:03,738
No, I'm sorry too. It's okay.

137
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,448
Come on. Let's just have coffee.

138
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:08,284
No. I was going to leave
after seeing you guys.

139
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:12,121
I've got to get to the set.
Bye, enjoy the coffee. Good luck.

140
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:13,331
- You too.
- Bye, guys.

141
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,290
Thank you.

142
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,375
Sure.

143
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:34,143
Do you remember Myeong-sik?

144
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,106
He and I used to run
a barbecue restaurant together.

145
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,401
He runs a chili farm in the country.

146
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,195
I'm grateful that
he sends me some every year.

147
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:45,989
Grateful for what?

148
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,074
He ran off with your money.

149
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:52,161
You're right.

150
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,622
I have nothing to thank him for.

151
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:04,549
It's hot out here.

152
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:07,510
You don't want to be on TV
with a sunburned face.

153
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,307
The chilies will burn your eyes.
Go downstairs.

154
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,735
You should put on a hat or something.

155
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,832
Yeah, I paid the hospital directly.

156
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,210
No, don't worry about it.

157
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,379
Bye.

158
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:50,595
After Ki-baek left,
I wondered what he was up to,

159
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,347
but you know what?

160
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,557
He's good at reality shows.

161
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,477
You know he's a pro
when he puts his mind to it.

162
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:59,312
You're close with him, aren't you?

163
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:00,355
Yes.

164
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:04,651
Listen. If I ever go freelance,
put in a good word for me.

165
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:09,572
- You're thinking about going freelance?
- Life's unpredictable.

166
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:12,617
This salary just won't do.

167
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:14,285
You should think about it too.

168
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:17,163
You should make as much money
as possible while you're young.

169
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:32,720
{\an8}DEAR DAD

170
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:36,849
He's a no-go?

171
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:40,478
Man, we're all set up here.
You've got to be kidding me!

172
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,565
His appendix burst on his way here.
Can you believe that?

173
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:48,820
I've made some calls,
so let's wait a little longer.

174
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,406
Every minute we wait, we're wasting money.

175
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:55,118
We're a low-budget show.
We can't afford to wait.

176
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:58,496
We even have to set up lights
if it gets dark.

177
00:15:58,496 --> 00:15:59,664
Should we pull out?

178
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:01,916
What do we do?

179
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,503
Hey, were you able to move things around?

180
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:10,466
Oh. No, I understand. Bye.

181
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,022
Is anyone available for a show?

182
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:27,859
We got an urgent call
from <i>Local Live Info Show</i>.

183
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:31,195
The shoot is in Seoul, with In-cheol
as director and Woo-ju as writer.

184
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:39,996
Oh, man.

185
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:41,914
Ms. On!

186
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:43,124
Yes.

187
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,959
Why didn't you tell me?

188
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:46,753
Sorry?

189
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:48,546
You caught me off guard.

190
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:49,672
I knew you could do it.

191
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,654
Oh, Ki-baek.

192
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:15,656
Okay, let's get started.

193
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:16,741
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:21,496
I didn't know what we were doing today,
so I just came in a suit.

195
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:33,257
BRAISED RIBS WITH SEAFOOD

196
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,688
You didn't close the salon early
because of me, did you?

197
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:52,318
No. You said your mother won't feel better
until she sees me.

198
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:56,364
You make everyone feel better.

199
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:59,242
Oh, please. Let's go.

200
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:09,877
Please enjoy.

201
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,554
It's been a while.

202
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:22,723
Yes. I hope you've been well.

203
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:24,183
You've gotten quite old.

204
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,019
Come on, Mother.

205
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,147
Don't say something like that to her face.

206
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:30,731
Why don't we eat first?

207
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,733
You like the food here.

208
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:42,410
Well, you haven't aged at all.

209
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,830
- You're still as beautiful as ever.
- Stop seeing Yeong-won.

210
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,877
Mother.

211
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,514
Ma'am. Goodness.

212
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:08,477
For nothing in return?

213
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,563
You audacious skank.

214
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,941
How dare you pursue my son
when you're destined for a miserable life?

215
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:22,700
Don't ever come near my son again.
Take that and leave him alone.

216
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:25,286
All right, fine.

217
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:28,581
Please don't yell.
If your blood pressure rises,

218
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:31,709
we'll have to rush you to the hospital
in the middle of your meal.

219
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:34,545
You tramp. Are you mocking me?

220
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,673
Mr. Kim, where are you? Get my car ready!

221
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:40,635
Mom.

222
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:43,638
I told you. It's been over ten years
since Mr. Kim retired.

223
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,782
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

224
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:09,747
I hate you.

225
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:14,627
There's a thin line between love and hate.

226
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:31,185
Ji-hu called me and said it seemed urgent.

227
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:35,147
Thank you, Ki-baek.
The moment I saw you, I was dazzled.

228
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,149
Dazzled? I don't know about that.

229
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,859
You know <i>Local Live Info Show?</i>

230
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:41,279
We're doing a segment called
"Mr. Kim is on the Move,"

231
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,116
but since you're here,
we'll make it "Mr. Song is on the Move."

232
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:47,451
- Mr. Song is on the Move.
- Yeah.

233
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,872
You're an announcer,
so you know what to do, right?

234
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:54,083
You're introducing this restaurant
in a fun way.

235
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,628
You can relax and speak freely.

236
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:00,673
Can you be more specific about
how freely I can speak?

237
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,092
I might speak more freely
than you'd expect.

238
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,636
Well, it's...

239
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,931
You know, just be your usual self.

240
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:10,808
Like on <i>Couple's Paradise</i>. No filter.

241
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,060
Yeah.

242
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,818
GRANDMA'S BRAISED RIBS

243
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:22,153
FIND! TASTY TV

244
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:23,487
FEATURED ON KBC-TV

245
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:24,822
This is delicious, ma'am.

246
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:26,824
- It's great.
- Your ribs are killer!

247
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,701
- So good.
- It's like my grandma's.

248
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,328
It tastes just like my grandma's.

249
00:21:38,502 --> 00:21:41,797
If you're here to eat, grab a damn seat.
Why are you standing around?

250
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:46,010
- Should I sit over there?
- Are you going to eat standing up?

251
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,602
Sit.

252
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:55,686
Right.

253
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,899
I'll have the ribs, a large one.

254
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,943
- For how many?
- One.

255
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,445
- Then get a small one.
- Sorry?

256
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:07,990
You damn fool.
You're going to have a ton left over!

257
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:10,534
I was told to order a large.

258
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:16,499
You'd better take all your leftovers
with you, you damn fool!

259
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,168
Cut!

260
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,713
We'll continue when the food is ready.

261
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:28,511
Mom.

262
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:30,346
Mom, can I see you for a second?

263
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:33,432
Well, excuse me.

264
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,694
Mom, the microphone.

265
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:47,822
- Cover it like this.
- Right.

266
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:48,989
Mom!

267
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:51,909
You're not cursing enough today.

268
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,078
You have to make it more realistic.

269
00:22:54,662 --> 00:22:58,082
I've been sleep-deprived lately.
That's why.

270
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,461
It makes my heart race
to curse at strangers.

271
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,714
Mother, we're sending Ji-a
to an English-speaking preschool.

272
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:09,051
I even got you some deer antler extract.

273
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,053
That's right, Mom.

274
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:13,848
Pretend like you're acting
and make it realistic.

275
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:16,392
- You got this.
- Yeah. Okay.

276
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:17,476
Okay.

277
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:25,109
I'm at Grandma's Braised Ribs,
where the chef curses at you

278
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:28,404
but offers you food
that disappears into your belly.

279
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:32,158
Wow, the dish looks as rustic
as your way with words.

280
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:34,493
All right.

281
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,420
You don't cut it this way, you damn moron.

282
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:49,717
This meat on the bone is the best part.

283
00:23:49,717 --> 00:23:51,677
Are you going to throw all this away?

284
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,305
Perhaps I should throw it away.

285
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:55,681
I'm sorry?

286
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:59,393
The meat is too tough,
and the sauce is too spicy.

287
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:02,104
While you're here
preoccupied with cursing,

288
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:06,525
maybe your son and his wife are only
paying attention to how it looks.

289
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:10,988
Do you really need this
to make it look good in pictures?

290
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,532
It may look good enough for social media,

291
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:15,659
but as far as taste goes,
it's got nothing.

292
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:20,581
This place has had a good reputation
for over 20 years.

293
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:23,542
But it seems like your food
has changed so much.

294
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:31,634
How dare you say our food has changed?

295
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:36,305
Who's the goddamn bastard
who thinks our food has changed?

296
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:38,933
That'd be me.

297
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:39,850
What?

298
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,188
I used to come here all the time
with my friends when I was in college.

299
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:47,608
We'd come in,
order one small braised ribs

300
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:49,276
and share it with extra rice.

301
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:52,571
You'd throw in more meat
when you were giving us a sauce refill.

302
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:55,741
I felt bad
seeing you young boys like that,

303
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:58,285
so how could I not?

304
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,336
The radish kimchi
tastes exactly the same. It's good.

305
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:09,755
You make this one yourself, don't you?

306
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:13,342
You should do the same for the ribs.

307
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:19,306
They say times have changed now.

308
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:24,812
I hear young people these days eat
with their eyes, not with their mouths.

309
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:26,146
Come on!

310
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:29,108
You eat with your mouth, not your eyes.

311
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:31,568
- Right?
- Yes.

312
00:25:31,568 --> 00:25:35,030
Cut! We're not doing this.

313
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,074
Mr. Seong, we're not doing this.

314
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:39,576
Do you know how much
we've spent on marketing?

315
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:42,538
This reporter must be out of his mind!

316
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:45,207
Come on, sir. We're not done here yet.

317
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:47,918
We'll keep filming
and make it all good with editing.

318
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:50,671
Oh, forget it. Please just stop and leave.

319
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:52,840
Are you trying to ruin our business?

320
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,966
What are you doing?

321
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:55,843
- Can we talk?
- I can't believe this.

322
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:58,178
- Excuse me. Just a minute.
- I'm sorry.

323
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:00,014
How could he be so thoughtless?

324
00:26:00,014 --> 00:26:01,432
He must be crazy.

325
00:26:01,432 --> 00:26:02,641
I'm sorry.

326
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:06,854
I messed up again, didn't I?

327
00:26:07,604 --> 00:26:10,274
I didn't mean for things to go this way.

328
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:13,193
Ki-baek.

329
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:16,447
Were her braised ribs really good?

330
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,533
I swear they were really good.

331
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:23,454
Okay, let's do it.

332
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:24,413
Sorry?

333
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:26,707
If it's good, we should film it. Come on.

334
00:26:40,262 --> 00:26:44,266
{\an8}<i>Thanks for today.
I miss you, my dear Bok-ja.</i>

335
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:49,730
Excuse me. Hi.

336
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,732
Can you do my hair?

337
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:52,858
Of course.

338
00:26:53,442 --> 00:26:55,652
So, what can I do for you today?

339
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:58,822
Well, something that takes a long time.

340
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,866
I'm sorry?

341
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:05,245
Whatever takes the longest time.

342
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:06,497
What might that be?

343
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:10,793
You could get a perm,
or you could color or bleach your hair.

344
00:27:10,793 --> 00:27:12,294
That'd take a long time.

345
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,088
I'll do them all.

346
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:15,798
Sorry? All of them?

347
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:17,341
Yes.

348
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,594
Sure, well, please have a seat.

349
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:27,726
But if you do them all at once,
it'll damage your hair.

350
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:28,811
Maybe you should...

351
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:43,450
Ma'am.

352
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,912
Are you all right?

353
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,581
I'm okay.

354
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:21,697
If you want to stop filming, you can.

355
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:27,119
But you can also keep going if you want.

356
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:30,664
I'll help you.

357
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:41,341
- I said forget about it
- We'll be done soon. Calm down.

358
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:42,634
Just a few more scenes.

359
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:44,553
I said no.

360
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:46,472
We'll make it all good with editing.

361
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:49,892
- Forget it. No.
- It's going to be fantastic.

362
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:50,809
Please calm down.

363
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:53,896
- How do you expect me to calm down?
- Trust me on this.

364
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:55,105
Let's start back up.

365
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:08,285
Listen, dear.

366
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:09,995
Yes, Mother.

367
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:11,705
Clear the table.

368
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:13,707
I'm going into the kitchen.

369
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:15,876
Mom!

370
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:19,755
You can take the apron off, you damn fool.

371
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:21,799
Didn't you hear me?

372
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:25,010
And you, young man.

373
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:27,638
Sit back down.

374
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:32,601
All of you, take a seat.

375
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:36,647
I'll let you taste my braised ribs.

376
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:41,860
Whether you think it's good or bad,

377
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,571
you can go ahead
and sing about it on your show.

378
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:46,824
Everyone, take a seat.

379
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:49,660
Come on, sit. Go on.

380
00:29:59,461 --> 00:30:00,587
<i>- Good work.
- Well done.</i>

381
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:01,588
Good night, guys.

382
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,465
Good night. Take care.

383
00:30:04,383 --> 00:30:06,009
- See you next week.
- Good work.

384
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,803
- See you next week.
- Bye.

385
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:13,225
Jeong-heon, are you okay?

386
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:14,935
No, I'm not.

387
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:21,066
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

388
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:23,610
You've been working nonstop
this past month.

389
00:30:25,988 --> 00:30:27,322
Let's go home. I'm tired.

390
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:32,828
Okay. Tomorrow's shoot is at six.
Should I get it pushed back?

391
00:30:32,828 --> 00:30:34,371
No, it's fine.

392
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:36,123
Are you sure?

393
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:30,052
STILLS FROM COUPLE'S PARADISE

394
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:58,664
<i>Woo-ju...</i>

395
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,460
I hope you can leave it all behind,
right here.

396
00:32:04,586 --> 00:32:06,171
The old me

397
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:08,882
and the old us.

398
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:20,519
I was really mad at you.

399
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:24,731
Being mad means you lose,
but I couldn't help it.

400
00:32:25,315 --> 00:32:26,942
I was devastated and angry.

401
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:28,944
Woo-ju, back then, I--

402
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:30,028
But

403
00:32:31,113 --> 00:32:32,656
I'm not anymore.

404
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:37,703
You want me to leave it all behind.
I think I already have.

405
00:32:42,082 --> 00:32:45,210
I want to thank you.

406
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:51,216
I think I finally got some closure here.

407
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:55,053
Somebody once told me

408
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:59,975
that you can't turn on the switch
unless you turn it off first.

409
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:19,161
After all this time, I'm in your shoes.

410
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,552
The director wants to change the name
to "Mr. Song is on the Move"

411
00:33:35,552 --> 00:33:37,512
and replace the host with you.

412
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:38,930
Come on.

413
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,432
No, seriously.

414
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:43,518
If you score a few shows this way,
you'll feel a lot safer.

415
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:46,271
If you're going to be the writer,
I'll do it.

416
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:47,606
If not, then no.

417
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:51,943
I'm just a fill-in until the head writer
comes back from her honeymoon.

418
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,236
Then I won't do it.

419
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:57,199
What? You're not on the brink yet,
are you?

420
00:34:02,996 --> 00:34:05,582
Are we taking your car tomorrow?

421
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:09,002
Are you crazy? What are you talking about?

422
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:11,129
To shoot promos for <i>Couple's Paradise.</i>

423
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:15,092
What I mean is,
the two of us can't go together.

424
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:16,676
Aren't you going?

425
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:18,220
I am, but...

426
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:23,934
We're not in a relationship
where we can share a ride,

427
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:26,103
looking all chummy.

428
00:34:26,103 --> 00:34:29,439
If we're not in the kind of relationship
where we can share a ride,

429
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,816
then what are we?

430
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:34,402
Honestly, I'm worried.

431
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:38,115
<i>Couple's Paradise</i> has just premiered.

432
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,449
There's no stopping now.

433
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:47,332
No matter what Min Cho-hui did
and how it affected your decision,

434
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:51,253
you did choose her,

435
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,966
and I didn't choose anyone.

436
00:34:56,716 --> 00:34:58,093
Those are the facts.

437
00:34:58,927 --> 00:35:03,056
And we will have to
take responsibility for that.

438
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:07,352
Besides, you--

439
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:08,603
I like you.

440
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:12,858
And I'm not going to be able to hide it.

441
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:24,578
I'm not sure if it'll be okay for us
to be around everyone.

442
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:28,165
If I don't mess up, it'll be fine.

443
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,208
Even if I do...

444
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:33,920
you'll be next to me.

445
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,638
I'm home.

446
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:49,186
- Do you need a hand?
- It's okay. You can go.

447
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:52,105
- I'll help you.
- Go.

448
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:55,108
Okay.

449
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:10,373
{\an8}WEIGH TO GO GYM

450
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,764
Oh, my God.

451
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,991
- Hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

452
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:47,452
Hi.

453
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:51,081
Hi.

454
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,086
Shall we start the workout?

455
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:59,172
Oh, yes. The workout, of course.

456
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:00,715
This way, please.

457
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:02,384
Up.

458
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:05,428
Up.

459
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:12,269
You're going to feel the burn right here,
between your arms and chest.

460
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:14,854
- Now, again. Up.
- Up!

461
00:37:15,689 --> 00:37:18,024
Great. Okay.

462
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,153
Be careful.

463
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:25,240
You have to be slow
when you bring it down.

464
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:32,080
I think that's enough for today.

465
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,835
You're not just lacking muscle mass,
it's practically nonexistent.

466
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:39,296
Let's try different things
for the next session.

467
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:42,132
I'm not usually in such bad shape,

468
00:37:42,132 --> 00:37:45,468
but I've been really tired lately.

469
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:47,804
Man.

470
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:52,350
Make sure you consume protein
after working out.

471
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:56,646
And you're a heavy smoker,
so you've got to do cardio regularly.

472
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:57,939
You live close by, right?

473
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,649
You should walk here then.

474
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:02,485
Do you give these
to every member of the gym?

475
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:05,530
Do you still make a profit?

476
00:38:07,198 --> 00:38:09,868
Well, I recently reopened the gym,

477
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:12,329
and you're the first to join
since the reopening.

478
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:17,917
I can't believe you're the first member.
I haven't even started promoting yet.

479
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:21,671
Boy, what a coincidence.

480
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:24,382
It wasn't a coincidence.

481
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:29,304
See you next time.

482
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,480
63-1, DOKSEODANG-RO 39-GIL

483
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:45,278
Welcome.

484
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:48,865
Hello.

485
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,870
I'd like to change the color of my hair.

486
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:56,039
It's been a day.

487
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:03,296
I feel like this isn't exactly
the color I wanted,

488
00:39:03,296 --> 00:39:06,716
and I'm also thinking about
getting a perm.

489
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:11,638
Your hair will melt off.

490
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:16,267
Have a seat.
I'll give you a conditioning treatment.

491
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:22,482
How long will that take?

492
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,444
A long time.

493
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:47,090
Secure it so it doesn't wobble.

494
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,007
Okay.

495
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:49,968
- Is there a spare watch?
- Check from the front.

496
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,971
Yes.

497
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,056
Put in the gas can.

498
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:57,392
Oh. I-na, put in the gas can.

499
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:58,309
Okay.

500
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:04,190
You eat that all the time these days.
You never used to eat at work.

501
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,276
Someone said I'm cranky when I'm hungry.

502
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,237
You're cranky even when you're not hungry.

503
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:10,488
What?

504
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:12,991
Guys, let's get ready!

505
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,956
{\an8}I wish I could show you the set too,
my Cho-Chos.

506
00:40:21,124 --> 00:40:22,709
{\an8}Please be patient for now.

507
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:24,752
I'll tell you all about it next time.

508
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:31,384
Oh, the pop-up bakery shop is going to be
in two weeks in Apgujeong.

509
00:40:34,971 --> 00:40:35,847
I've got to go.

510
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:38,266
I'll do a live broadcast again soon.

511
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:46,024
It's been a while.

512
00:40:46,816 --> 00:40:48,693
Yes, it's been a while.

513
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:53,615
You look so beautiful.

514
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,993
Have you seen my Ki-baek?

515
00:40:56,993 --> 00:40:58,703
He said he'd come find me here.

516
00:41:09,464 --> 00:41:10,924
He must've told you everything.

517
00:41:13,968 --> 00:41:17,305
I don't want to take issue with it
and cause a stir here,

518
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:21,518
but you will have to explain your actions.

519
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,812
You can take issue with it all you want

520
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:27,232
because I did nothing wrong.

521
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:32,403
Also, I don't think it's me
who owes an explanation.

522
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:39,244
Everyone, stand by.

523
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,083
Min-gu, is Jeong-heon here? He's up first.

524
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:48,545
Yes, but they won't let anyone
in his greenroom.

525
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,756
What are you talking about?

526
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,149
You shouldn't do this. Just go home.

527
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,528
Mr. Kang, go tell them he can't do it.

528
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:16,072
Let's go.

529
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:18,366
Jeong-heon.

530
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:20,410
Take out the hairpin.

531
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:25,623
Come on.

532
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:36,009
You all look so different.

533
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:37,218
So do you.

534
00:42:37,218 --> 00:42:39,554
Like you wouldn't have ten billion won.

535
00:42:40,138 --> 00:42:41,180
You look starved.

536
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,933
This is what they call
a special favor for the final couples?

537
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:46,769
Come on, I'm jealous of you.
You guys will--

538
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:50,231
- They'll get a million views for sure.
- Definitely.

539
00:42:50,231 --> 00:42:53,318
Wow, you guys look great in your costumes.

540
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,072
You look great, really.
This is going to be huge.

541
00:42:59,532 --> 00:43:00,992
Where's Ki-baek?

542
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:04,287
Oh, Ki-baek is making rice cakes.

543
00:43:04,287 --> 00:43:05,371
Already?

544
00:43:14,714 --> 00:43:17,675
The shoot hasn't even started yet.
Do we have to do this?

545
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:21,346
If we don't practice now,
we'll look awkward later.

546
00:43:22,388 --> 00:43:24,932
But we're one of the final couples.

547
00:43:26,434 --> 00:43:27,727
We should be doing that.

548
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:38,738
{\an8}HAVE A GREAT CHUSEOK

549
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:40,823
Have a great Chuseok

550
00:43:41,574 --> 00:43:43,284
with <i>Couple's Paradise</i>.

551
00:43:46,954 --> 00:43:48,039
Yeah, okay.

552
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,000
We'll do each couple
and then do a group scene.

553
00:44:13,523 --> 00:44:15,983
Oh, you don't have to do that.

554
00:44:17,402 --> 00:44:19,862
Wow, that's so romantic.

555
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:23,700
It's so obvious
that he's not over Woo-ju yet.

556
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,301
Ki-baek,

557
00:44:42,885 --> 00:44:44,262
are you upset about something?

558
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:46,431
Me? Why do you ask?

559
00:44:47,056 --> 00:44:48,558
Do something about your face.

560
00:44:53,312 --> 00:44:55,273
Let's start making songpyeon.

561
00:44:56,399 --> 00:44:58,985
Look at that.
My baby is good at making songpyeon too.

562
00:44:58,985 --> 00:45:01,446
Right? I know a thing
or two about cooking.

563
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:02,655
For my character,

564
00:45:02,655 --> 00:45:05,825
shouldn't I just wait
and take your songpyeon?

565
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:07,827
My character wouldn't be
doing this either.

566
00:45:09,412 --> 00:45:11,581
What's that?
It doesn't look like songpyeon.

567
00:45:13,082 --> 00:45:15,543
The ugly ones actually
taste better, you know.

568
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:19,797
My mom said if your songpyeon is pretty,
you'll have pretty babies.

569
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:20,715
Is that an egg?

570
00:45:20,715 --> 00:45:23,050
You're supposed to make songpyeon.

571
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:32,059
Please put your songpyeon on the tray.

572
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:44,447
What's that?

573
00:45:44,447 --> 00:45:45,865
Why did you make a heart?

574
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:48,326
Oh, that's cool.

575
00:45:48,326 --> 00:45:49,410
A heart?

576
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:55,416
Oh, they said
I could make it however I want.

577
00:45:56,626 --> 00:45:58,461
Did you make that for Cho-hui?

578
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:00,379
No.

579
00:46:06,802 --> 00:46:10,640
Songpyeon is easy to eat,
but it's hard to make.

580
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,850
Yeah.

581
00:46:13,434 --> 00:46:15,228
- Woo-ju.
- Yes?

582
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:19,190
You look so much better than
the last time I saw you.

583
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:22,401
She's right.
Are you dating someone, Woo-ju?

584
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:24,779
No.

585
00:46:25,821 --> 00:46:27,573
After the final shoot, did you...

586
00:46:35,248 --> 00:46:38,000
secretly start to date Jeong-heon?
Did you?

587
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:40,336
No, I didn't.

588
00:46:40,336 --> 00:46:41,504
No.

589
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:46,842
All right, then.
We'll steam your songpyeon.

590
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:48,386
- Okay!
- Okay.

591
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:01,524
- Good work today.
- Take care.

592
00:47:01,524 --> 00:47:02,984
- Bye.
- See you.

593
00:47:02,984 --> 00:47:04,527
- Really?
- Yeah...

594
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:09,323
- Mr. Song Ki-baek?
- Yes?

595
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:13,327
Do you have anyone
assisting you with your work?

596
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:14,453
Like a talent agency.

597
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:16,247
No.

598
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:23,004
Let's have a cup of tea sometime.

599
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:34,807
See you.

600
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:36,309
Yeah.

601
00:47:38,644 --> 00:47:40,438
Jeong-heon. Come on.

602
00:47:58,164 --> 00:48:00,041
I should've turned off the switch.

603
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,001
A heart? Seriously?

604
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:04,128
We didn't make any eye contact,

605
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:06,922
and we barely said anything to each other.

606
00:48:06,922 --> 00:48:09,925
That songpyeon almost gave us away.

607
00:48:10,468 --> 00:48:12,678
Everyone thought
you were seeing Jeong-heon.

608
00:48:13,888 --> 00:48:16,474
It's not often we get to wear
those kinds of costumes.

609
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,976
You looked so beautiful today.

610
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:22,813
We had angel, woodcutter, noblewoman
and servant costumes

611
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:24,774
but we didn't take any pictures in them.

612
00:48:24,774 --> 00:48:26,901
Are you going to keep complaining?

613
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:32,323
What?

614
00:48:46,504 --> 00:48:47,588
What's this?

615
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:50,466
You're brooding over
not taking any pictures together,

616
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:52,009
so let's do it, Mr. Rice Pounder.

617
00:48:52,551 --> 00:48:55,304
Wait, you're being so forward.

618
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:57,807
I love it.

619
00:48:58,891 --> 00:49:01,018
Just look at the camera.

620
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:03,187
It sends the photo to your phone too.

621
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:04,271
Okay.

622
00:49:12,238 --> 00:49:13,364
We're not there yet.

623
00:49:14,323 --> 00:49:16,117
Then let's make a heart.

624
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:18,744
You and your hearts.

625
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:19,995
Come on, let's do it.

626
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:29,213
You have such a pretty smile.

627
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:31,590
I can't say you're paying lip service.

628
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,510
You have a real knack
for making things awkward.

629
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,179
Didn't you say it's cute when I'm honest?

630
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:38,973
That's...

631
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:41,767
You can stop being honest.

632
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:43,936
You know I can't help it.

633
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:17,470
Oh, my God!

634
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:23,684
Oh, my dad.

635
00:50:34,528 --> 00:50:36,071
Oh, hey, Ki-baek.

636
00:50:36,864 --> 00:50:38,824
Hi. What are you doing?

637
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:40,242
Exercising.

638
00:50:40,242 --> 00:50:42,661
I used to box, remember?

639
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:44,705
I still throw some jabs sometimes.

640
00:50:44,705 --> 00:50:46,707
I do remember, but--

641
00:50:46,707 --> 00:50:49,418
I'd better get home. Good night.

642
00:50:58,511 --> 00:51:02,723
Well, if you saw it, you can just say so.

643
00:51:03,682 --> 00:51:07,144
Shadowboxing at this late hour
seems a little random.

644
00:51:07,144 --> 00:51:09,396
I was just flustered.

645
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,899
I've never seen you with a woman.

646
00:51:14,276 --> 00:51:17,071
Are you guys in a relationship?

647
00:51:19,824 --> 00:51:21,200
- No.
- It didn't seem like it.

648
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:24,537
Then what? Just casually dating?

649
00:51:24,537 --> 00:51:26,372
Well, you saw it.

650
00:51:28,415 --> 00:51:29,625
I'm not sure.

651
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:33,045
Uncertainty between a man
and a woman can be bad.

652
00:51:33,045 --> 00:51:34,755
You'd better make things clear.

653
00:51:35,464 --> 00:51:36,632
Will you keep it a secret?

654
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:39,176
Please, I'm asking you.

655
00:51:40,135 --> 00:51:43,681
This is also the first time
you've ever asked me for something.

656
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:47,393
Right. We should get home. Let's go.

657
00:52:05,703 --> 00:52:07,371
She talks so much in person.

658
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:09,164
WRITER ON WOO-JU

659
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:12,877
But she never texts me first.

660
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:20,342
We're not in a relationship where we can
share a ride, looking all chummy.

661
00:52:23,888 --> 00:52:26,891
<i>Uncertainty between a man
and a woman can be bad.</i>

662
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:29,101
<i>You'd better make things clear.</i>

663
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:35,649
WRITER ON WOO-JU

664
00:52:38,444 --> 00:52:39,945
NAME

665
00:52:48,454 --> 00:52:51,457
They asked for our confirmation.
You should take a look.

666
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:54,835
Ms. Ma said you need to see your doctor.

667
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:56,086
I can take care of myself.

668
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:03,677
She said you have to talk to Dr. Choi
about your difficulty breathing yesterday.

669
00:53:05,763 --> 00:53:08,682
Jeong-heon. I'm really worried about you.

670
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:11,268
Why are you overstraining yourself?

671
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:13,646
You'll get sick
if you keep bottling things up.

672
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:14,563
You're right.

673
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:19,360
I bottled it up and got sick.

674
00:53:24,907 --> 00:53:26,075
Hyeong-taek.

675
00:53:26,075 --> 00:53:26,992
Yeah?

676
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:29,995
I need the day off.
Clear my schedule for this afternoon.

677
00:53:31,413 --> 00:53:32,247
Okay?

678
00:53:32,998 --> 00:53:34,124
I'll go see the doctor.

679
00:53:36,168 --> 00:53:37,586
- Hello.
- Hello.

680
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:39,588
Please follow me this way.

681
00:53:39,588 --> 00:53:40,965
Okay.

682
00:53:40,965 --> 00:53:42,174
This is expensive stuff.

683
00:53:46,011 --> 00:53:47,304
Please wait here.

684
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:48,389
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

685
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:50,975
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

686
00:53:53,018 --> 00:53:54,061
Man...

687
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:57,731
Why are you having a meeting
at a hair salon?

688
00:53:57,731 --> 00:54:00,609
- Are you sure I can be here too?
- I'd feel awkward alone.

689
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:02,569
Say you're here to get your hair done.

690
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:05,280
Hey, they charge you 77,000 won
for a haircut here.

691
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,657
What?

692
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:09,868
I hear all the big shot
freelance announcers come here.

693
00:54:09,868 --> 00:54:12,246
I guess everything
will come up roses for you now.

694
00:54:13,122 --> 00:54:14,123
Roses?

695
00:54:14,123 --> 00:54:15,874
Please. I'm in the jungle.

696
00:54:15,874 --> 00:54:20,045
Instead of the jungle, perhaps you should
think of it as the land of opportunities.

697
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:22,589
I didn't know you had company.

698
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:24,591
This is Yoon Ji-hu, a JBC announcer.

699
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:27,678
Hey, this is Director Ma Mi-ra
of Forever C&C.

700
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:29,680
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Ji-hu.

701
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,348
Right. Nice to meet you too.

702
00:54:33,851 --> 00:54:36,478
Let's cut it a little bit
and add some curls.

703
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,155
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M AT A HAIR SALON

704
00:54:46,155 --> 00:54:47,322
I'M AT HOME

705
00:54:47,322 --> 00:54:51,160
I'M A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW

706
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,541
OKAY, TEXT ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE

707
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,049
How many TV shows do you think are

708
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:07,593
available for
a freelance announcer to host?

709
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:11,013
Thirty? Fifty?

710
00:55:11,889 --> 00:55:15,225
Even just with the major TV stations,
K has 29 variety shows

711
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:17,186
and 65 current affairs and cultural shows.

712
00:55:17,186 --> 00:55:19,938
S has 8 variety shows,
23 current affairs and cultural,

713
00:55:19,938 --> 00:55:23,067
and M has 24 variety shows
and 30 current affairs and cultural.

714
00:55:23,067 --> 00:55:25,027
But since they have in-house announcers,

715
00:55:25,027 --> 00:55:27,279
cable channels are
the best bet for freelancers.

716
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:31,950
Even just the four major ones
roughly have more than 100 variety shows

717
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,996
and 200 current affairs and cultural shows
airing 24-7.

718
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,665
There are hundreds of shows available.

719
00:55:41,877 --> 00:55:45,130
The days when you had to work
for some coffee money

720
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,423
are now over.

721
00:55:47,007 --> 00:55:49,510
Hey, you're going to make some big money.

722
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,844
Variety shows? Cultural?

723
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:53,889
You can do anything you want
if you work with me.

724
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:55,599
What about news shows?

725
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,727
Right. News.

726
00:56:00,646 --> 00:56:04,817
Why not? If you're capable,
the possibilities are endless.

727
00:56:06,777 --> 00:56:09,154
Oh, Ms. Ma. You're here.

728
00:56:09,154 --> 00:56:10,447
Hi, Ms. Sim.

729
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,032
Is Jeong-heon coming here today?

730
00:56:12,032 --> 00:56:14,118
He said he was going to the hair salon.

731
00:56:14,118 --> 00:56:16,495
No, he didn't make an appointment.

732
00:56:16,495 --> 00:56:18,664
What's going on?

733
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:19,998
Did he go someplace else?

734
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:22,960
Ms. Sim, did you guys have an argument?

735
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,130
No! Of course not.

736
00:56:33,053 --> 00:56:35,597
I'm a big fan of yours, Jeong-heon.

737
00:56:35,597 --> 00:56:37,891
What? Thank you.

738
00:56:38,433 --> 00:56:41,311
I bet you can't find one person
in this country who dislikes you.

739
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:43,313
That's not true.

740
00:56:44,189 --> 00:56:46,066
My daughter liked you so much too.

741
00:56:47,067 --> 00:56:49,444
She'd go on and on about you,
calling you her "Heony."

742
00:56:49,987 --> 00:56:54,158
She was spending night after night
with a guy I'd never even met,

743
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:58,412
and I still made kimchi
and all kinds of other dishes for him.

744
00:56:58,996 --> 00:56:59,997
Right.

745
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:03,250
She always puts on a naive smile at work,

746
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:07,379
so people don't know
how she's really feeling inside. But...

747
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:12,676
I do.

748
00:57:15,012 --> 00:57:16,388
I can tell.

749
00:57:18,098 --> 00:57:22,519
I know when that fool's feelings are hurt,
just by looking at her face.

750
00:57:24,188 --> 00:57:27,691
I don't know what happened
because Woo-ju never told me.

751
00:57:28,984 --> 00:57:30,277
But you know what?

752
00:57:30,277 --> 00:57:33,572
I don't care if her "Heony"
is some beggar in the street

753
00:57:33,572 --> 00:57:36,283
or the biggest celebrity in the country.

754
00:57:37,117 --> 00:57:40,329
If he's the kind of guy who casts
a shadow over my daughter's face,

755
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:41,955
I will end him.

756
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:46,710
I'm sorry I came so late, Ms. On.

757
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,463
I'm sorry.

758
00:57:51,006 --> 00:57:52,591
I came to apologize today.

759
00:57:57,846 --> 00:57:59,681
I didn't realize until it was too late.

760
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:05,020
He said he wanted to get married.

761
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:09,525
He's told you
about our family situation, right?

762
00:58:10,192 --> 00:58:15,030
His successful father has always
treated him like a troublemaker,

763
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:20,827
but he's worked hard to live the life
he wants and never asked us for anything.

764
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:27,334
I'll be honest. I pried a little.

765
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:31,588
He said he wants to get married
but didn't tell me anything about you.

766
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:33,215
Oh, right.

767
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:35,926
You are

768
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,554
as beautiful as he said.

769
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:41,390
Thank you.

770
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,603
I hear your parents are both teachers.

771
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,731
And that they work in another region.

772
00:58:52,109 --> 00:58:54,736
And I heard you work
at a broadcasting station.

773
00:58:54,736 --> 00:58:57,489
You two probably understand
each other well then.

774
00:58:58,031 --> 00:58:59,241
JBC, is it?

775
00:59:00,617 --> 00:59:01,952
<i>Back then,</i>

776
00:59:02,744 --> 00:59:07,291
<i>I thought I was protecting Woo-ju
by lying.</i>

777
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:12,629
I hope you won't be offended
by what I'm about to say.

778
00:59:14,256 --> 00:59:20,387
You and Jeong-heon can get married
whenever you want.

779
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:25,976
Just give me some time
to convince my husband.

780
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:31,773
You can marry him
and join our family then.

781
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:33,483
Okay?

782
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:37,988
I'm sorry.

783
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:39,990
No, I'm sorry.

784
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:45,120
Such a beautiful and wonderful woman
like you says she likes Jeong-heon.

785
00:59:47,748 --> 00:59:48,832
Thank you.

786
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:56,506
<i>I hid Woo-ju's wound
so no one could rub salt in it.</i>

787
00:59:59,801 --> 01:00:02,220
What Woo-ju really wanted from me

788
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:06,099
was just to accept it as it was, but I...

789
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:09,394
I was foolish.

790
01:00:16,193 --> 01:00:17,319
I'm sorry, Ms. On.

791
01:00:18,528 --> 01:00:20,322
I know I hurt you too.

792
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:27,329
Come out of there already.

793
01:00:52,437 --> 01:00:54,815
SONG KI-BAEK:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

794
01:00:54,815 --> 01:00:56,650
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

795
01:01:00,237 --> 01:01:01,488
Want to grab dinner?

796
01:01:01,488 --> 01:01:03,740
Since we got a haircut,
how about a food court?

797
01:01:04,825 --> 01:01:06,493
- Ji-hu.
- What?

798
01:01:07,953 --> 01:01:09,121
I like On Woo-ju.

799
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:10,038
And?

800
01:01:10,038 --> 01:01:11,998
What? You knew?

801
01:01:11,998 --> 01:01:16,336
No. But you two have been
through thick and thin,

802
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:18,380
and you live upstairs from her.

803
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,715
It's not a surprise.

804
01:01:20,298 --> 01:01:21,341
I see.

805
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:23,677
So, food court?

806
01:01:23,677 --> 01:01:25,804
When I was talking to Ms. Ma earlier,

807
01:01:25,804 --> 01:01:27,681
I kept thinking about Woo-ju.

808
01:01:28,932 --> 01:01:33,186
Thinking that I want to talk
to her about my future.

809
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:35,897
I'll just go by myself.

810
01:01:36,481 --> 01:01:38,900
She's the only one
I want to talk to about that stuff.

811
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,736
I want a special relationship with her.

812
01:01:41,737 --> 01:01:43,447
But I don't know.

813
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:48,368
I don't know if she feels
the same way about me.

814
01:01:48,368 --> 01:01:50,746
And where we stand exactly.

815
01:01:54,624 --> 01:01:55,625
Listen, Ki-baek.

816
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,338
I chased after my wife for a year
before we started dating.

817
01:02:00,338 --> 01:02:02,048
Guess how many times I asked her out.

818
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:03,675
Ten times?

819
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:06,386
No, if I had,
I would've been arrested for stalking.

820
01:02:06,386 --> 01:02:07,304
How many times?

821
01:02:07,304 --> 01:02:08,430
Just once.

822
01:02:09,431 --> 01:02:12,893
All I could do was hover around her,
and it was driving me crazy.

823
01:02:12,893 --> 01:02:16,104
So one day, I got myself really drunk,
went to her house,

824
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:18,690
and I sang.

825
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:22,444
- She didn't call the cops?
- Her neighbor did.

826
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:25,947
She came down to the station
to give a statement.

827
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:31,286
I asked her out that day,
and she said yes, just like that.

828
01:02:31,912 --> 01:02:34,080
I wasted a year for nothing.

829
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:39,044
So you never know until you ask.

830
01:02:40,378 --> 01:02:43,006
Hi, Sol.
Are you in the mood for a Swiss roll?

831
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:45,175
Yeah, all right.

832
01:02:46,968 --> 01:02:49,387
Ki-baek. Don't waste your time
and go ask her.

833
01:02:49,387 --> 01:02:50,472
I'll see you.

834
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,601
Bye.

835
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,621
I'm sorry, Woo-ju.

836
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:16,832
I'm sorry.

837
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,378
That's what I came to say.

838
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:25,966
But I guess I'm too late.

839
01:03:35,392 --> 01:03:38,728
<i>Where are you?
I really need to talk to you today.</i>

840
01:03:42,107 --> 01:03:43,275
Oh, they have...

841
01:03:50,031 --> 01:03:51,032
No.

842
01:03:52,117 --> 01:03:53,118
Thank you

843
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:55,078
for telling me this.

844
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:59,749
I thought about it a lot, actually.

845
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:05,046
I thought, "Maybe he was really just
trying to protect me."

846
01:04:06,965 --> 01:04:10,468
"Maybe he was trying his best
to love someone who's got a story

847
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,055
that people would frown upon."

848
01:04:16,057 --> 01:04:17,893
Because I loved you so much.

849
01:04:19,311 --> 01:04:22,606
I tried to rationalize it
and understand you.

850
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:26,860
But

851
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:29,738
now I really do understand.

852
01:04:32,824 --> 01:04:34,492
So don't be sorry.

853
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:55,805
Why isn't she responding?

854
01:04:57,182 --> 01:04:58,224
Is she busy?

855
01:05:07,984 --> 01:05:10,362
SONG KI-BAEK: I WANT TO SEE YOU

856
01:05:11,237 --> 01:05:13,740
Is Song Ki-baek the person
in your heart right now?

857
01:05:18,578 --> 01:05:20,330
Why am I so nervous?

858
01:05:22,707 --> 01:05:23,917
Should I tell her tomorrow?

859
01:05:27,879 --> 01:05:28,880
Let's tell her.

860
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:30,840
I should tell her.

861
01:06:39,993 --> 01:06:41,911
