NEWS AT NOON

3
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:15,631
{\an8}Good afternoon,
and welcome to <i>JBC News at Noon.</i>

4
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:16,882
{\an8}SONG KI-BAEK

5
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:20,845
{\an8}It's been four years
since workplace bullying was prohibited

6
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:25,433
{\an8}under the revised Labor Standards Act,
which took effect in July 2019.

7
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,769
{\an8}Some say it has contributed
to raising awareness,

8
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:33,983
{\an8}but many people are still suffering
from workplace conflict and harassment.

9
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:38,696
{\an8}Kim Seo-jun has more on the story.
Reporter Kim Seo-jun.

10
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:41,824
{\an8}Reporter Kim Seo-jun.

11
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:46,996
Reporter Kim Seo-jun?

12
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,665
Reporter Kim Seo-jun.

13
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:52,460
{\an8}REPORTER KIM SEO-JUN

14
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,922
Yes. How are things on Planet Warr?

15
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:01,177
{\an8}Yes. I'm here because
I received a tip-off that Tyranno Max,

16
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,305
{\an8}the one who protects Planet Warr,

17
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,766
{\an8}forced Agent Harry
to go hunting against his will.

18
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,726
He made an herbivore dinosaur go hunting?

19
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,978
{\an8}That is wrong and unfair.

20
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:15,608
{\an8}That's right. But Harry has to get
a reference letter from Max,

21
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,693
{\an8}so he's been crying every night.

22
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,279
Hey, behave yourself.

23
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:22,198
Oh, boy. The situation seems serious.

24
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:25,034
Pachycephalosaurus and Brachiosaurus
also belong to

25
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:29,038
the Herbivore Dinosaurs Association.
Has the HDA made any moves yet?

26
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:33,459
I think it's wrong to order others around,
just because you're strong.

27
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:37,379
That wasn't in the script, you know.

28
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:38,756
Dad!

29
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:42,551
- Hold on. Is that a camera?
- Yes, it is.

30
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:43,552
Whoa.

31
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,182
Isn't this considered
workplace harassment?

32
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:52,019
Did he really have to bring his son
to work for his work experience?

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,815
I really respect Ki-baek.

34
00:02:55,898 --> 00:02:58,317
He came two hours early
and waited on standby for this.

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,401
- God.
- Look at this.

36
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,570
Why would he do this?
He already has it all.

37
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:02,947
He's going overboard.

38
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,867
He doesn't have it all.

39
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:10,287
You think it's easy
to get the main news anchor title?

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,416
It's not like you guys would do this
if he told you to.

41
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,919
Mr. Kim pesters you until you give in.

42
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:18,170
Look at that.

43
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:20,172
And Ki-baek knows to put up with it.

44
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,424
I joined JBC
because of Ki-baek's news show.

45
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,884
What a letdown.

46
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:26,345
We may be announcers
in front of the camera,

47
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:28,389
but we're all just employees after all.

48
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:32,059
Don't come any closer!

49
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,313
Oh, Ki-baek. The closing line.

50
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:44,863
I sincerely promise you
that I'll only report the truth

51
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:46,532
and never lie to you.

52
00:03:48,617 --> 00:03:51,120
{\an8}Song Ki-baek, <i>JBC News</i>.

53
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,665
{\an8}All right, let's take a picture.
Everyone, gather around.

54
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:58,419
All right.

55
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:01,297
One, two, three.

56
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:03,632
{\an8}I WANT TO BE A REPORTER!

57
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:05,801
{\an8}ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK
WISHING YOU HAPPINESS

58
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,438
{\an8}All right. Let's get ready!

59
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,489
{\an8}Be punctual, will you?

60
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:30,451
{\an8}Just an FYI.
We changed the opening line slightly.

61
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:36,749
All right. It's 11:57.
We have three minutes.

62
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,750
Stand by.

63
00:04:41,337 --> 00:04:42,338
Ki-baek.

64
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:46,759
Be patient, and you'll soon be able
to anchor the main news show.

65
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:51,013
Kudos for putting up with that
this morning.

66
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,516
Your body reacts to stress right away.

67
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,519
Someone from hair and makeup
bought this from Japan.

68
00:04:58,562 --> 00:04:59,980
It's good for the stomach.

69
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:10,199
Hye-yeon, your phone keeps buzzing.

70
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:21,043
Is something wrong?

71
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:22,962
Yes. What?

72
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:27,508
Hye-yeon, you don't look so well.

73
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:28,842
<i>Are you all right?</i>

74
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,345
Let's focus.

75
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:33,764
- All right, guys. Stand by.
- Stand by.

76
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:35,224
Stand by.

77
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:53,075
<i>Ready.</i>

78
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:55,494
All right. Here we go.

79
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,538
Cue.

80
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:05,170
EPISODE 1: IT'S A LIE

81
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,755
<i>Good afternoon,</i>

82
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,882
<i>and welcome to</i> JBC News at Noon.

83
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:14,096
<i>Last week saw the highest number</i>
<i>of new flu cases reported since 2000.</i>

84
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,180
Enjoy.

85
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:16,223
Thank you.

86
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:21,270
I'm Kim Joo-ho.

87
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,898
WRITER HYE-JIN:
DID YOU MEET HIM?

88
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:26,108
YES, WE MET UP JUST NOW

89
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:27,484
GOOD LUCK

90
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:29,570
Oh, let me.

91
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,781
I'm sitting closer. Just wait here.

92
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,951
You're very efficient.

93
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:39,621
Time is precious, you know.
Let me go get our precious coffee.

94
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:40,998
Sure.

95
00:06:57,055 --> 00:07:01,185
Oh, right. On TV, I've seen writers
working away in fancy studios.

96
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,061
Not variety show writers.

97
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:05,355
When I'm working,
I don't even have time to sit.

98
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,232
I even have to eat standing up.

99
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,359
You know the office caste system?

100
00:07:09,443 --> 00:07:12,321
Oh, are writers the second caste?

101
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:13,697
Then I could sit and work.

102
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:18,160
If there were ten castes,
then writers would be

103
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:19,912
at rock bottom.

104
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,205
Rock bottom?

105
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,791
We have countless annoying, petty tasks.

106
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:28,045
From planning, casting, location scouting,
and from editing to comforting the cast.

107
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,172
At times, I wonder
if I'm just an errand girl.

108
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:34,551
That's right. I am an errand girl.

109
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,595
One who runs all sorts of petty errands.

110
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,851
Well, then you're probably
too busy to date anyone.

111
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:45,270
Oh, please.
We can always find time to date.

112
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:48,107
Years ago, we went to go shoot
in Thailand.

113
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,942
Back then, we were so busy.

114
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:53,362
On the day we were coming back,
a writer burst into tears at the airport.

115
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:55,614
I got worried and was like,
"What happened?"

116
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:58,367
All of a sudden,
a handsome Thai boy showed up and…

117
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:09,711
Was Bangkok's full name in the script?
Or is he improvising?

118
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:10,796
Improvising, I think.

119
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,673
Song Ki-baek never disappoints.

120
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,093
A city with a beautiful name, Bangkok.

121
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:21,849
I haven't been to Bangkok,
but to celebrate Visit Thailand Year…

122
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:24,810
What's with Hye-yeon today?
Did something happen?

123
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:25,936
I wonder too.

124
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,730
Most people don't know
Bangkok's full name.

125
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:32,067
You must be very interested in Thailand.

126
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:33,485
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,988
<i>Ki-baek is on a roll these days.</i>

128
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,739
This show's ratings have gone up.

129
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:40,325
Also, I heard he was born
into a wealthy family.

130
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,120
He's from a good family
on top of being competent and kind.

131
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:46,665
<i>He has it all, which is clearly why</i>
<i>he's always so relaxed.</i>

132
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:47,624
<i>I'm jealous.</i>

133
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,710
<i>That's why we call him</i>
<i>the blue-chip stock.</i>

134
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:54,298
The main anchor position always goes to
the young and rich, the tall and handsome.

135
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:56,717
He'll be the main anchor
of the nine o'clock news.

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,844
<i>He'd be the first male announcer to do it.</i>

137
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,220
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

138
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,806
<i>Must be nice to be that successful</i>
<i>at a young age.</i>

139
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:05,726
<i>Way to go.</i>

140
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:07,227
So what's happening now?

141
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:09,563
Just keep him there a few more minutes.

142
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:11,815
I'll be right there. Okay, I have to go.

143
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:15,611
Was that one of those "annoying" tasks?

144
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,654
That's right.

145
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,116
If someone you know
wants to be a variety show writer,

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,367
talk them out of it.

147
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:25,495
Variety shows are really fun
when you're watching them.

148
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:28,415
I'm a huge fan of <i>Men on the Run.</i>

149
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:31,126
I rush home from work
to watch it and enjoy a solo drink.

150
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,337
- You're a <i>Men on the Run</i> fan?
- Sorry?

151
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,214
It's why I can put up with my job.

152
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:38,383
Falling asleep, laughing after eating
in the comfort of your own home.

153
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:39,968
It feels so awesome.

154
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:43,430
That's why I can't run away
from this hellhole.

155
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:47,059
- Oh, boy.
- Right.

156
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:47,976
Yes.

157
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:52,522
I see.

158
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,862
Email me the details, and I'll go over it.

159
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:02,532
{\an8}As you already know,
the show is quite popular.

160
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:04,451
Appearing in it is great marketing.

161
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:07,621
The doctor on the previous team
opened a new clinic in Gangnam.

162
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:08,956
I see.

163
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:12,334
Oh, you can get going. You seem busy.

164
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,463
Variety show writers have
such a tough job.

165
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:19,299
Being unfunny is what's stressful for us,
not being busy.

166
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:23,679
Anyway, I really have to go.
I'll be in touch.

167
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:26,223
All right. Bye.

168
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,767
Yes, I'll be there shortly.

169
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,435
I told you I'd be right there.

170
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:34,231
About 20 minutes?
Hold on. No. Ten minutes.

171
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:36,525
I bet she really has no time to date.

172
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,028
ON WOO-JU
MEN ON THE RUN WRITER

173
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,113
<i>It's such a shame.</i>

174
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:44,157
The system must be expanded

175
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:46,910
so children in need
will no longer be left out.

176
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,123
Hye-yeon, your phone keeps buzzing.

177
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:55,043
HUSBAND: I'LL TEACH YOU TWO
A LESSON, JUST WAIT AND SEE

178
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,683
Hye-yeon, aren't you
going to say your line?

179
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,813
As adults, it is our duty
to protect children.

180
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:17,399
It's important to pay attention
in your day-to-day life.

181
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,028
VCR, cue.

182
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:25,157
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Yes.

183
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,199
Are you insane?

184
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:28,535
The director is watching this.

185
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,620
<i>Another reshuffle is coming.</i>
<i>Get it together!</i>

186
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:33,165
Hye-yeon.

187
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:34,750
Let's focus, okay?

188
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,919
Camera three, show Ki-baek.

189
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,424
Here's today's weather.

190
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,981
- Hello.
- Where is he?

191
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,609
Oh, the producer told us
not to call you, but--

192
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,319
Then you shouldn't have called me.

193
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:04,196
He said no female guests.

194
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,616
Why? Yesterday, he even said he'd go
to the salon early to prep for the shoot.

195
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:08,867
Well, the thing is…

196
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,868
What's the problem?

197
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:10,786
Well…

198
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:14,081
- His girlfriend won't let him.
- Quiet.

199
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:14,998
What?

200
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,209
He can't even make eye contact
with other women.

201
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,545
No, that's…

202
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,590
It's fish sauce. She drank it.

203
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,511
It's weak. Put in more fish sauce.

204
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:28,887
This won't do.

205
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,597
- What?
- Isn't this fish sauce?

206
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,848
Yes, it's strong enough.

207
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:33,308
Jesus.

208
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:37,813
Listen, trust me on this.
I'll make you look like Chae Chi-su today.

209
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:42,150
The team captain who only thinks about
basketball and his team. What do you say?

210
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:45,070
I can't be in the same frame
with the female guests.

211
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:48,615
Can't you just say
I'm not feeling well today?

212
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:52,994
I mean, I could.
But the show's called <i>Men on the Run.</i>

213
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:54,454
You need to actually run.

214
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:56,581
I'll tweak things
so you'll have no issues.

215
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:00,544
Who is she?

216
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:05,590
Who is it this time? Tell me.
I'll go and persuade her.

217
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:06,508
What? Cut it out.

218
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:09,928
Because of her,
you can't think rationally right now.

219
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:10,846
Punch in her number.

220
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,723
It's because
I'm really not feeling well today.

221
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:16,935
Hey, Kim Seong-hun! Who is she?

222
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,734
Isn't that your husband?

223
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:29,739
- What are you doing? Get out!
- Honey?

224
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:30,782
Director!

225
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,450
Kim Seong-hun, you son of a bitch!

226
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,705
Kim Seong-hun should be punished
for destroying my family.

227
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:38,999
He slept with my wife. That…

228
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:48,800
Wait, I-- Hold on.

229
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:53,346
{\an8}You all need to know the truth
about that bastard who slept with my wife!

230
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,182
Please don't do this. We're on air.

231
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,141
- Why not?
- Get out!

232
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:58,310
I'm doing this to get you guys in trouble.

233
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,483
I apologize.

234
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,485
That was an unexpected--

235
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,827
I apologize for the interruption.
Please understand--

236
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:19,372
<i>Kim Seong-hun, you scumbag.</i>
<i>Do you know who I am? You bastard.</i>

237
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,625
<i>You'd better come here now. Right now!</i>

238
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:23,710
Please…

239
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:30,133
What are you waiting for?
Switch on the ending signal!

240
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:32,260
Call the police. Dial 112.

241
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,638
Hey! What is going on?

242
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:38,099
What is happening?

243
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:39,017
Let go.

244
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,311
What are you waiting for? Switch that off.

245
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:42,729
Hurry!

246
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,864
The ending signal!

247
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:55,659
Someone barged into the studio.

248
00:14:58,036 --> 00:14:58,995
<i>At noon…</i>

249
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:02,791
WHO WATCHES THE NEWS THESE DAYS?

250
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:05,961
ISN'T IT ALL FAKE NEWS ANYWAY?

251
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:09,297
<i>I sincerely promise you</i>

252
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,133
<i>that I'll only report the truth</i>
<i>and never lie to you.</i>

253
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:13,093
NEWS AT NOON

254
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:14,594
A NEW BEGINNING FOR KOREAN NEWS

255
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:16,846
Security!

256
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:19,766
Security!

257
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:23,728
You're just going to leave?

258
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:24,896
- Woo-ju!
- Woo-ju!

259
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,106
What now?

260
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:29,317
We have a big problem.
Seong-hun's name is all over the news.

261
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:30,860
- What do you mean?
- Woo-ju, look.

262
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:33,613
KIM SEONG-HUN HAVING AN AFFAIR?

263
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,034
- I'm screwed. Hey, let's go!
- But…

264
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:40,245
What? Wait, Seong-hun!

265
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:42,914
Oh, no.

266
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,503
My gosh. They're 12 years apart.

267
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:49,796
Seriously.

268
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:58,388
My apologies. It's all my fault.
I should've handled it better.

269
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:00,890
Of course. Clearly, it's not my fault.

270
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:03,518
How was I supposed to know in advance

271
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:06,354
that the announcer's husband
would cause a scene

272
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:08,898
because his wife was having an affair
with Seong-hun?

273
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:18,199
I'm sorry. I understand I should
take responsibility as the head writer.

274
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:19,284
<i>Why are you sorry?</i>

275
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,912
Those cheaters owe us an apology.
Why are you always apologizing?

276
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,456
{\an8}KIM SANG-JIN

277
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,666
{\an8}Damn it.

278
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,212
How dare they bring an abominable
personal matter into the news studio?

279
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:35,342
This happens when people don't separate
their personal and professional lives.

280
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,260
You know?

281
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:39,804
- Right?
- Yes.

282
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:41,431
You're absolutely right.

283
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,309
But we do have to follow the protocol,

284
00:16:44,392 --> 00:16:46,645
so we'll need to submit a report.

285
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:51,524
It's really embarrassing though, you know?

286
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:54,277
So you take care of it
and get it sorted out.

287
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:55,236
Sure.

288
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,905
Ensure uninvolved parties aren't affected.

289
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:59,240
Especially people like…

290
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:01,284
Like me.

291
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:03,370
Yes, sir.

292
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:05,538
You can go now.

293
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,960
Oh, about the audition
for the main anchor position.

294
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,714
Yes. You said you'd give me
an update today.

295
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,051
I got your name on the list of candidates.

296
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:18,968
I see.

297
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:21,012
But the thing is,

298
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:25,392
I'm not sure if it's a good thing
or a bad thing.

299
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:27,143
What do you mean?

300
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:32,023
You know, your face is everywhere
because of the incident on the news today.

301
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:35,735
Everyone in the country
knows your name now.

302
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:41,449
You see, I think it could help you out,
but at the same time…

303
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:48,998
So it could give me a competitive edge
over the other candidates?

304
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,710
That's right.

305
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:56,005
So don't be discouraged.
Go and get ready for the audition.

306
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:59,718
I'll prepare thoroughly and do my best
so I won't miss this opportunity.

307
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:02,971
Oh, Seong-gyu! Mr. Superstar.

308
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,931
To what do I owe the pleasure?

309
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:07,726
What? You can go.

310
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:10,395
Hey, well…

311
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:13,022
Can I get your autograph? Just a couple.

312
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,819
CHEATING AND PUNISHMENT
BIZARRE TV NEWS BLUNDER

313
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,826
Guess your shoot ended early.

314
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,870
Yes.

315
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:32,125
Tantan had to attend an event
in the countryside, so we ended early.

316
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:36,379
Hey, are you all right? I read the story.

317
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,799
Your face looked awful in that photo.

318
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:45,472
Who cares about my face?
It destroyed the news program's dignity.

319
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:46,890
Spoken like a true anchorman.

320
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,811
Oh, right. I heard you
turned down <i>Golden Family.</i>

321
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,521
For the episode featuring announcers.

322
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,191
Everyone wants to be on that show.

323
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:59,277
Do you even visit your family these days?

324
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,363
Your mom's been calling me.
She said she couldn't reach you.

325
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:05,825
God, you scared me.

326
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:06,993
Oh, I'm sorry.

327
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,453
I see that you're working hard.

328
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:12,499
Man, you handled that so well.

329
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,584
I would've peed my pants, for sure.

330
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:17,295
Are you really going to
turn down <i>Golden Family?</i>

331
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:20,715
They said they'd contact me
if you said no.

332
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:24,219
Oh, it doesn't work with my schedule.
You should do it.

333
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:29,641
Heard your family can't do it.
Do they live far away?

334
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:30,892
Yes.

335
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:32,018
Do they live abroad?

336
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,229
Oh… Hey, I'm off.

337
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:36,314
Well, they live far away.

338
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:40,318
So you live alone in that big house
in Seongsu-dong?

339
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:43,822
Rumor has it you'd make headlines
in the finance section

340
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:47,325
if your house were to be revealed.
Is it true?

341
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:49,911
It must be true.

342
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:53,706
No wonder Mr. Kim always has your back
and no one else's.

343
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,416
What do you mean, he has my back?

344
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,126
All he does is dump work on me.

345
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,586
You know how he is.

346
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,882
He's keeping you by his side
because he knows he can benefit from it.

347
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:15,687
Will I really be all right?

348
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,565
Mr. Kim, please put in a good word for me.

349
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:22,443
It's the stress.

350
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:26,364
Cancel the show?
Are you really going to do this to me?

351
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:29,200
When you asked me to help
a program pulling in 3% in ratings,

352
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:31,828
I pulled all-nighters for three months
without complaining.

353
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:34,831
Now, the ratings are at a whopping 18%.

354
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:39,294
All right, I heard you.
Then persuade the no-show first.

355
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:43,089
Sure thing.
You cannot cancel the show, ma'am.

356
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:45,925
Woo-ju, you'd better step up your game.

357
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,637
I heard your rival show on tvM
might cast Kim Jeong-heon.

358
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:51,389
- Who?
- My goodness.

359
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:54,392
You don't know who Kim Jeong-heon is?
Everyone's ideal son-in-law.

360
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:56,269
Mr. Honey Bunny.

361
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:58,605
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

362
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:15,079
Hello? Hey.

363
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,881
{\an8}CLOSED FOR INSPECTION

364
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,175
{\an8}When people get off, you can get started.

365
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,676
<i>…get started.</i>

366
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:32,180
Has he lost his mind?
How dare he say he'll drop out?

367
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:35,058
Hey, make sure Mr. Kim doesn't leave.

368
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,435
I'll be there in three… No, in one minute.

369
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:40,188
Make sure he doesn't leave
until I get there.

370
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:41,689
Do whatever it takes.

371
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:46,027
Well, lock the door or cause a scene.
I'll be there shortly, okay?

372
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:49,405
What? I can't hear you.
I'm in the elevator now.

373
00:21:51,032 --> 00:21:52,784
I said, I'm in the elevator now.

374
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:58,122
What?

375
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:00,541
What is this?

376
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:11,135
Nothing's going my way today.

377
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:21,396
Mr. Song Ki-baek?
Can you give me a hand?

378
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:27,360
It's dangerous to force open the doors
when the elevator's not working.

379
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,114
I know that because I worked on
<i>Emergency Escape Number 3,</i>

380
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:32,991
but I don't have time for this.

381
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:35,243
Maybe they're doing a routine inspection,

382
00:22:35,326 --> 00:22:36,744
so let's wait a bit.

383
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:48,464
Did you fart?

384
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:50,925
Did you poop?

385
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:53,594
No, I did not.

386
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:59,225
Also, the official medical term
is "flatulence," not "fart."

387
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:02,019
Okay. So it was a wet fart.

388
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:05,273
Ouch.

389
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:10,570
Hurry up and help me open this!

390
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,947
It was just a fart this time,
but if it happens again,

391
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,490
you won't be able to hold it in.

392
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:17,785
I can't really move
or use my physical strength right now.

393
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:19,454
Seriously.

394
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:21,914
I guess I've been under a lot of stress.

395
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:24,167
And I think I have indigestion.

396
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:25,960
Don't care, didn't ask.

397
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:27,628
Just don't poop in here.

398
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:29,422
Don't you worry.

399
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:38,639
They're under inspection.
Use that elevator.

400
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:42,810
- It's over there.
- Hello?

401
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:45,646
Hello? We're trapped in here!

402
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:48,816
We're in this elevator.

403
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:54,822
What do we do?
Hello? We're trapped in here!

404
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:56,616
We're inside!

405
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:57,825
You're in the elevator?

406
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:00,077
Yes, we're trapped in here!

407
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,078
One moment!

408
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,628
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right.

409
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:10,505
Okay, just one moment.

410
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:11,464
Okay.

411
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:14,842
Can you move?

412
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:21,474
Well, I'm in a rush too. Cheer up.

413
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:23,643
Pull me out, please.

414
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:29,148
- Are you all right?
- Thank you.

415
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:31,150
Yes, I'm coming.

416
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:32,318
Are you all right?

417
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,821
What are you doing?
You don't want to come out?

418
00:24:37,782 --> 00:24:38,658
Hurry up.

419
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:42,912
Come on out!

420
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:45,206
Keep out!

421
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:49,794
Is he okay?

422
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:51,128
What should we do?

423
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:52,255
Are you okay?

424
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:53,673
Did something bad happen?

425
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:18,865
Man, it's only 3:00 p.m.

426
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:25,872
JBC, WE CAN DO IT!

427
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:28,332
{\an8}SMOKE-FREE FOR 87 DAYS,
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK

428
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:38,092
How about a beer after work?

429
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:40,803
- I'm supposed to see my friends today.
- Damn.

430
00:25:41,387 --> 00:25:43,514
Oh, right. The audition for main anchor.

431
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:45,808
I heard some announcers were applying too.

432
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:47,810
I heard Song Ki-baek was doing it.

433
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:50,021
Hey, buddy. We have to bring our A-game.

434
00:25:50,104 --> 00:25:54,108
The main anchor is like the face of JBC.
We can't let an announcer take the job.

435
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:57,737
Why not? Because it has never happened
in the history of JBC.

436
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,113
Come here.

437
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:03,075
When the CEO is finalizing his decision,
he collects the employees' opinions.

438
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,122
He asks all the producers and directors
what they think about the candidates.

439
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:09,874
Oh, I see.

440
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:13,711
Hello, Mr. Song.

441
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:16,672
Ki-baek!

442
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:18,257
Director Kim, why…

443
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:19,717
Hey, are you free now?

444
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,385
I have a no-show for a live show.

445
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:23,429
Can you spare me an hour…
No, half an hour.

446
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:26,557
Oh, I'm sorry.
I really want to help you, but…

447
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:29,936
When the CEO is finalizing his decision,
he collects the employees' opinions.

448
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:34,106
He asks all the producers and directors
what they think about the candidates.

449
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,734
I mean, I want to help you, so I will.
Let's go.

450
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:39,820
This way.

451
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:42,907
THROW OUT

452
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:53,417
Guys, we have to do the shoot this week.

453
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:55,503
If not, we'll all be screwed.

454
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:57,213
- Let's make it happen.
- Yes, ma'am.

455
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,382
I-na, that profile I printed earlier…

456
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:08,557
It's removable, right?

457
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,309
{\an8}Last time, you used waterproof…

458
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,563
I threw out
those waterproof face markers right away.

459
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:17,024
This is a PPL product,
so I want to test it--

460
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:17,942
Okay.

461
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:20,569
I just want to test it.

462
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:22,738
Keep your eyes peeled.

463
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:24,365
The pay…

464
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:28,744
{\an8}Announcers are our only option if we
consider the pay and the tight schedule.

465
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:32,248
{\an8}Do we really have to play
this game right now?

466
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:36,460
Woo-ju said we should try things ourselves
to make sure they'll be successful.

467
00:27:36,544 --> 00:27:38,504
Yes, it could help us come up
with useful ideas…

468
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:40,965
Here. Go for it.

469
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:46,012
- I'm sorry.
- Do we really have no one else?

470
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:47,805
EMPLOYEE RECORD, SONG KI-BAEK

471
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:51,017
Damn it. What's "announcer" in Korean?

472
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,393
<i>Ki-baek! This way.</i>

473
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:54,437
- Quick!
- Go inside and get ready!

474
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,771
We're good now. He's here.

475
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:58,399
Get ready! Ki-baek, go inside. Get ready.

476
00:27:58,482 --> 00:27:59,442
We can do this.

477
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:02,653
Just change the opening line.
I trust you'll do great!

478
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:07,199
Calm down. Okay, ready.

479
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:13,497
Now, we're on.

480
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:21,797
Hello. I'm Song Ki-baek, the special DJ
for <i>The Man Who Reads Poetry.</i>

481
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:27,344
I-na. Hey, I-na.

482
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:31,807
I-na.

483
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,976
I-na!

484
00:28:38,105 --> 00:28:39,607
How many days have you not changed?

485
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:42,943
Nine days.

486
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,783
Don't go to the sauna.
Use this to cab home.

487
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:51,077
Go home and come back.

488
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:52,912
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

489
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,998
No, not for you.

490
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,462
- Ouch.
- What's so interesting?

491
00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:03,214
I want in on it.

492
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:05,466
This is the real-time chat
for a radio show.

493
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,051
A radio show? Is it funny?

494
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:09,720
A close friend of mine is one
of the show's writers.

495
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:11,806
They have a special DJ for the day,

496
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:13,849
and the regular listeners are teasing him.

497
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:15,059
Want to take a listen?

498
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:18,938
You're monitoring someone else's show?
Way to go, I-na. Let's hear it.

499
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:25,486
<i>In this segment,</i>
<i>the poems you requested are read.</i>

500
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,405
The next poem is…

501
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:29,865
I'M SORRY

502
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,716
"Upo Wetland" by Kim Ba-da.

503
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:52,555
"The Upo Wetland shrouded by fog
Is where the birds live

504
00:29:55,182 --> 00:29:57,810
<i>Waek, waek, waek, waek, waek, waek</i>

505
00:29:57,893 --> 00:30:04,150
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack
Qua-quack, qua-quack, flutter, flutter

506
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:09,029
Aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck
Aeck, waek, aeck, weak, aeck, weak

507

Aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck

00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:25,045
Du-du, du-du"

512
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:26,338
This is an actual poem?

513
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:28,382
His diction is so good. Who is this guy?

514
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:29,675
Song Ki-baek, the announcer.

515
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:30,801
Song Ki-baek?

516
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:32,928
Oh, the poopy pants.

517
00:30:33,762 --> 00:30:35,347
He's got a really nice voice.

518
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:38,142
Right? Everyone in the chat room
is going wild.

519
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:39,727
He hasn't gotten a syllable wrong.

520
00:30:40,394 --> 00:30:44,398
"Qwock, qwock, qwock"

521
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:48,611
That was "Upo Wetland" by Kim Ba-da.

522

{\an8}"UPO WETLAND" FROM COW DUNG
BALLS ARE THE BEST! BY KIM BA-DA

523
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:59,205
I've never seen Song Ki-baek appear
on a variety show.

524
00:30:59,288 --> 00:31:02,750
He doesn't have to do what he doesn't like
because his family is well-off.

525
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:05,377
He only does what he wants to.
Namely, news programs.

526
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:07,755
He was the one
who got attacked on the news.

527
00:31:07,838 --> 00:31:10,966
I heard it was a hot mess.
Can he still anchor news shows?

528
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,718
I guess we could try asking him.

529
00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:16,263
I think he stays away from variety shows
because of his image as an anchor.

530
00:31:16,347 --> 00:31:19,892
It's our job to pull down
the likes of him off their high horse.

531
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:22,603
My gut's telling me to go for it.

532
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,389

We're screwed.
We have no one left to call.

552
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:24,266
I've got one left.

553
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:29,938
Let's ride on his coattails
while everyone's talking about him.

554
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:31,857
Like discovering a new dark horse.

00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:35,569
- Am I going overboard?
- Yes, you are going overboard.

556
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:37,613
We have nothing to lose anyway.

557
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:42,785
Let's do this and see
where it takes us, Song Ki-baek.

558
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:49,625
Why am I so cold all of a sudden?

559
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:52,336
<i>He's so handsome.</i>

560
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:53,796

<i>the ideal son-in-law.</i>

565
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,561
My god, what's with that hideous costume?

566
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,271
What's wrong with the way I look?

567
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:14,817
Jeong-heon, can't you see
how awful you look right now?

568
00:34:15,776 --> 00:34:18,237
I told you to go straight home
after yesterday's shoot.

569
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:21,198
I went straight home.

570
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:22,491
With the whole crew?

571
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:24,326
Either way, I did go straight home.

572
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,995
How much longer
are you going to wear this T-shirt?

573
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,914
That show's director must be retired now.

574
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:30,165
He retired last year.

575
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:32,209
So as his retirement gift…

576
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:35,587
Hyeong-taek, what did I send?
Oh, the full fishing set. That's right.

577
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:37,339
And why did you agree to do this show?

578
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,133
Your schedule is full.

579
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:41,218
I told them you'd join next season.

580
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:42,636
You should've played dumb.

581
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,471
Why did you have to step in?

582
00:34:45,848 --> 00:34:47,099
We'll start at 1:00 p.m.

583
00:34:47,182 --> 00:34:48,142
Got it.

584
00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:49,893

you wouldn't make Jeong-heon sing.

593
00:35:25,554 --> 00:35:27,848
What? I didn't ask him to sing.

594
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:30,559
This was Jeong-heon's idea.

595
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:33,228
He hasn't sung in years.

Garak-dong.

Garak-dong? Why?

00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:02,776
What? Cut it out.

625
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,530
Hey, you know I have a knack
for discovering new variety show stars.

626
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:08,949
Song Ki-baek, there's something about him.

627
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:11,368
He looks like a perfectly ironed shirt,

628
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:14,621
but I can sense his inner loser.
He's perfect variety show material.

629
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,499
Man, I'm tired. Let's go home.

630
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,918
Let's get some sleep
and talk again tomorrow.

631
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:22,170
Good night. I mean,
have an inspiring night.

632
00:37:22,254 --> 00:37:23,547
All right.

633
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,425
Nice. A new car!

634
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,406
What?

635
00:37:53,076 --> 00:37:55,495
Look at that scaredy-cat acting all tough.

636
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:03,670
Let's go.

637
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:16,892
{\an8}A variety show?

638
00:38:17,476 --> 00:38:19,227
You told me to prep for the audition.

639
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:21,480
I did? When?

640
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:23,649
Oh, come on. Then what?

641
00:38:23,732 --> 00:38:27,110
Should I tell you to sit around
and do nothing as your manager?

642
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:29,863
You said everyone knowing my face
was a good thing.

643
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:31,531
Everyone does indeed. Look.

644
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:34,576
{\an8}Your face is everywhere.
But in a ridiculously embarrassing way.

645
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,870
What are you going to do?
You call this an anchor?

646
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:38,789
Look. Isn't this <i>Comedy Big League?</i>

647
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:41,375
Did he get an earful from the higher-ups?

648
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,502
He recommended Ki-baek for main anchor

649
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:46,171
and got chewed out
for disgracing the network's reputation.

650
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:49,466
The way he changes his stance
is as swift as Son Heung-min's footwork.

651
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:54,054
I do want to participate in the audition.

652
00:38:54,137 --> 00:38:56,932
Please just listen to me, okay?

653
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:00,185
I'm only suggesting this
because I know you can do it.

654
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:02,729
You excel at everything.
Why are you being so stubborn?

655
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:04,314
For the time being,

656
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:07,943
you should focus on variety shows
and culture shows.

657
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:10,862
I mean, you've got an offer.
How nice is that?

658
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:13,115
Others are dying
to appear on variety shows.

659
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:14,783
I want to do it too.

660
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,243
I'd say yes right away.

661
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:22,040
You know I can't go back to news programs
once I start appearing in variety shows.

662
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:23,709
Come on, these days, everyone…

663
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,961
You can do it, Ki-baek.

664
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:28,046
- Sorry?
- I have high hopes for you.

665
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,506
But…

666
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:34,720
Oh, Ms. On.

667
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:37,055
Hello.

668
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:40,684
Hello. She's the head writer
of the variety show I told you about.

669
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:43,186
Have a good talk, you two.

670
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:54,156
You remember me, right?

671
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,408
We escaped from that elevator together.

672
00:39:56,491 --> 00:39:57,743
ON WOO-JU

673
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:00,912
Let me introduce myself.

674
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:03,123
I'm On Woo-ju,
head writer of <i>Men on the Run.</i>

675
00:40:04,374 --> 00:40:05,500
I'm Song Ki-baek.

676
00:40:05,584 --> 00:40:07,210
Have you ever watched <i>Men on the Run</i>?

677
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:08,670
Yes. Of course I have.

678
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:14,051
The "men" on the show get together

679
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,221
and travel all over the country…

680
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:21,224
- Running around together.
- They race.

681
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:22,184
"My bro's leg is"?

682
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:23,894
"Worth a million dollars."

683
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:26,313
No, you got it wrong.

684
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:31,193
The regular cast members
and the guests split up into teams

685
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:33,236
and play indoor ball games.

686
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,530
Yes, that's right. I know the show.

687
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:38,700
I must've confused it
with a different show. Sorry.

688
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:41,745
If you're sorry, join us
and learn more about the show.

689
00:40:41,828 --> 00:40:43,663
I really want you on the show.

690
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:45,540
People trust you,
yet you'd be a new face.

691
00:40:45,624 --> 00:40:46,833
You're perfect.

692
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:49,377
Thank you for the offer, but…

693
00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:53,673
It's not that I don't trust you.
We're headed in different directions.

694
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:58,970
I believe I'm better suited for programs
that have depth than lighthearted shows.

695
00:40:59,054 --> 00:41:02,724
Those who make variety shows cry
a hundred times before a show premieres.

696
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:05,185
It hurts my feelings
to hear variety shows lack depth.

697
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:14,528
Also, I was in an accident years ago,
and my ankle never fully healed.

698
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:17,447
I haven't been able to play
strenuous sports for a long time.

699
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:21,993
I see. You have a bad ankle.

700
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:23,203
Well, it's too bad.

701
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:27,040
You scored the most goals in last year's
staff basketball tournament.

702
00:41:27,124 --> 00:41:28,583
You set a record.

703
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:31,628
{\an8}JBC STAFF BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT
TOP SCORER, SONG KI-BAEK

704
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:35,298
The tournament was organized
by the company,

705
00:41:35,382 --> 00:41:38,051
so I wanted to do well.

706
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:42,472
I guess I'm getting old.
My legs are getting weak.

707
00:41:44,307 --> 00:41:47,102
Don't tell me you hate variety shows.

708
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:49,563
Or is it because
you want to protect your image.

709
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:52,232
No, that's not the case at all.

710
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:54,901
Oh, I have a shoot.

711
00:41:56,444 --> 00:41:58,780
I wish you and your show all the best.

712
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:01,741
There's a cockroach.

713
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:03,743
- Where?
- Oh, no. Right there.

714
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:05,078
It's moving toward…

715
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:10,750
Careful not to hurt your ankle again.

716
00:42:13,628 --> 00:42:15,005
Right. Thanks.

717
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,016
How dare he lie to my face?

718
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:35,775
I FAILED TO PREVENT MY
CO-WORKER'S EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR…

719
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:37,527
Damn it.

720
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:42,073
I mean, I am the victim.

721
00:42:45,785 --> 00:42:47,078
Oh, there you are.

722
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:48,955
Oh, yes. Hello.

723
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,081
What is this?

724
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:54,586
Man, just get it done quickly.

725
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,298
Hey, can you take care of the dubbing
for <i>World's Table?</i>

726
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:00,592
Mr. Kim said you weren't busy.

727
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:02,886
By when?

728
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:05,305
Well, take your time
to finish this up first.

729
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:08,433
Come to the recording studio
on the tenth floor in half an hour.

730
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:09,559
What? Half an hour?

731
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:13,980
I think Mr. Kim and Mr. Heo are going out
for drinks even though it's still early.

732
00:43:14,064 --> 00:43:15,649
They invited me all of a sudden.

733
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:17,901
Hey, I'll put in a good word for you.

734
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:21,112
I should vouch for you
so you can get your show back.

735
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:23,949
Thank you.

736
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:25,158
I'll count on you, then.

737
00:43:28,495 --> 00:43:30,247
- Is Ki-baek in there?
- Yes.

738
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,503
Heard you're writing a report.

739
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,296
It must be stressful.

740
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:41,633
You like green juice.

741
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:45,929
The day after tomorrow,
do you have any plans for the evening?

742
00:43:46,012 --> 00:43:46,930
No, I'm free.

743
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:48,723
For the evening?

744
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:50,141
Can you cover my night shift?

745
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:52,560
I was asked to host
a pre-production press conference

746
00:43:52,644 --> 00:43:54,562
and can't turn it down.

747
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:56,856
Mr. Kim said you weren't busy these days.

748
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:03,196
Sure, but aren't those press conferences
normally held in the early afternoon?

749
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,073
The director invited me
to their team dinner.

750
00:44:05,907 --> 00:44:07,033
Cover my shift, please.

751
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:15,000
Right, I only have 30 minutes.

752
00:44:19,587 --> 00:44:21,715
Why didn't you erase it?
I can see it clearly.

753
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:23,591
Well, Sol likes this.

754
00:44:23,675 --> 00:44:25,719
What are you going to do
about the variety show?

755
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:28,263
Did you say you had a bad ankle?
Do they not care?

756
00:44:28,346 --> 00:44:32,684
Thought they'd give up if I made excuses,
but they even called Mr. Kim.

757
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:34,519
They even know I went hiking last week.

758
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:36,438
Then try and persuade Mr. Kim.

759
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:39,149
No, just go ahead and rebel.

760
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:41,276
Have it out with him.
Tell him you want a news show.

761
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,695
Hey, that's crazy talk.

762
00:44:43,778 --> 00:44:45,822
If you don't think you can persuade him,

763
00:44:45,905 --> 00:44:48,700
then just accept it.

764
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:50,410
Everyone is supportive of the idea.

765
00:44:50,493 --> 00:44:52,620
Gaining variety show experience
wouldn't be bad.

766
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:55,373
Being supportive?
They're trying to push me out.

767
00:44:55,457 --> 00:44:59,127
You took on <i>Pyororong Witch School</i>
thinking it'd be a one-off appearance,

768
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,463
but it's been five years.

769
00:45:01,546 --> 00:45:03,506
I'm doing this because Sol likes it.

770
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:07,093
You know how hard I worked to become

771
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:09,846
the first male announcer
to get the main anchor title.

772
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:12,057
My efforts are about to go down the drain.

773
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,977
Then keep acting up and tell them
you'd rather die than do it.

774
00:45:16,061 --> 00:45:18,063
What will happen to my image, then?

775
00:45:18,146 --> 00:45:19,314
For God's sake.

776
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:22,025
You figure it out.

777
00:45:37,373 --> 00:45:40,376
MR. KIM: I TOLD THEM
YOU DECIDED TO DO MEN ON THE RUN

778
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:51,930
IT'S ON WOO-JU, THE WRITER

779
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:54,015
PLEASE SAVE MY NUMBER

780
00:46:13,326 --> 00:46:16,121
{\an8}NATIONAL DODGEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP

{\an8}LET'S PLAY TOGETHER
AND HAVE FUN!

783
00:46:35,807 --> 00:46:37,475
PN!

784
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,936
PN, look here and strike a pose.

785
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,273
<i>Oh, hey. Careful.</i>

786
00:46:43,356 --> 00:46:45,483
- You have something on your face.
- I do? What?

787
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:46,985
Handsomeness!

788
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:49,112
Thank you. You have something here.

789
00:46:50,196 --> 00:46:51,698
<i>Would you take a picture with me?</i>

790
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:52,907
No photos, please.

791
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:54,742
It's all right.

792
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:56,369
<i>All right, I love you all.</i>

793
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:58,329
<i>Don't wait for me out in the cold.</i>

794
00:46:58,413 --> 00:46:59,998
No, we will wait for you!

795
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:02,458
- We love you, PN!
- We love you, PN!

796
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,043
Ditto!

797
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:07,005
I love you!

798
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:09,257
{\an8}LET'S PLAY TOGETHER!

799
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,341
SOLOMON'S SEAL TEA

800
00:47:10,425 --> 00:47:11,467
LET'S PLAY TOGETHER!

801
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:12,969
MEN ON THE RUN, LET'S HAVE FUN!

802
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:15,305
Oh, hello.

803
00:47:15,388 --> 00:47:16,973
Yes, hello.

804
00:47:17,056 --> 00:47:19,142
- Hello.
- Hello.

805
00:47:19,225 --> 00:47:20,894
- Hello.
- Hello!

806
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:22,437
Wait.

807
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:25,440
Oh, we're wearing the same shoes.

808
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:29,444
Great minds think alike.

809
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:31,112
- We'll catch up in a bit.
- See you.

810
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:32,322
A MEN'S BALL GAME
AND THEIR SHOWDOWN!

811
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:33,406
MEN ON THE RUN

812
00:47:49,005 --> 00:47:50,465
You said it was a limited edition.

813
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,300
You said there were
only three pairs nationwide.

814
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:53,927
Yeah, I know.

815
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,888
Who knew we'd see two of them here?

816
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:58,890
Do you want to wear something else?

817
00:48:01,684 --> 00:48:02,769
Why should I do that?

818
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:05,313
Go tell that idiot
to wear different shoes.

819
00:48:09,025 --> 00:48:09,984
I'm barefoot.

820
00:48:10,068 --> 00:48:12,820
I'll have a talk
with his stylist, all right?

821
00:48:12,904 --> 00:48:14,572
Don't blame it on me. Be diplomatic.

822
00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:17,533
He promised to sing on my new single,

823
00:48:17,617 --> 00:48:19,035
so don't make me look like a jerk.

824
00:48:19,118 --> 00:48:22,163
- All right.
- Oh, PN. Here's your milk.

825
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:30,255
- What the hell?
- What's wrong?

826
00:48:31,464 --> 00:48:32,757
I wanted soy milk!

827
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,675
Soy milk?

828
00:48:33,758 --> 00:48:36,177
I get diarrhea when I drink milk
on an empty stomach.

829
00:48:36,844 --> 00:48:37,762
I drink lactose-free.

830
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:40,098
Oh, I thought I heard you say
you wanted milk.

831
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:41,474
I never said that, you little--

832
00:48:41,557 --> 00:48:42,558
Hello, PN!

833
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:45,687
- You're here.
- Hello.

834
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,355
Did you practice playing dodgeball?

835
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:49,524
Oh, I took the ball.

836
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:52,360
I took it with me when I went
to record the music show.

837
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:53,820
Oh, my.

838
00:48:53,903 --> 00:48:56,531
Anyway, are you the only cast member
in this room?

839
00:48:57,448 --> 00:48:59,409
Where did he go?

840
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,215
What are you doing there?

841
00:49:16,676 --> 00:49:19,304
Oh, I had a nap on the couch in the back.

842
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:22,724
I conked out.

843
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:26,144
You should meet everyone.

844
00:49:26,227 --> 00:49:27,395
Come out and say hi.

845
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:29,105
Say hi.

846
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:32,442
I bet you've never worked with
a K-pop idol on a show before. Right?

847
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:35,903
Hello. I'm PN.

848
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:38,281
I can call you "bro," right?

849
00:49:38,364 --> 00:49:40,074
Oh. Yes, PN.

850
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,414
Please talk casually
once the shoot begins.

851
00:49:50,877 --> 00:49:53,046
All right, <i>Men on the Run</i>.
And we're rolling!

852
00:49:54,005 --> 00:49:56,758
{\an8}Hello, viewers of <i>Men on the Run</i>.
It's nice to meet you.

853
00:49:56,841 --> 00:49:58,259
{\an8}Today's game is a big match.

854
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:00,053
{\an8}- Yes.
- I'm really excited for it.

855
00:50:00,136 --> 00:50:03,890
{\an8}Men on the Run versus
Donkeys the Dodgeball Kings.

856
00:50:03,973 --> 00:50:05,850
{\an8}- It begins now.
- Yes, so it begins.

857
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:07,935
{\an8}<i>Ki-baek and PN are getting ready</i>
<i>for the jump ball.</i>

858
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:08,853
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

859
00:50:10,188 --> 00:50:11,481
{\an8}<i>It's in their court now.</i>

860
00:50:11,564 --> 00:50:13,983
{\an8}<i>Song Ki-baek got the ball.</i>
<i>Then it went to Kim Chan-u.</i>

861
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:15,318
Pass it over.

862
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:18,404
{\an8}<i>It's passed back to Song Ki-baek,</i>
<i>and Song Ki-baek throws it!</i>

863
00:50:18,488 --> 00:50:19,405
{\an8}<i>PN dodged it!</i>

864
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:21,491
{\an8}Oh, Chan-yeong got hit. Chan-yeong is out.

865
00:50:21,574 --> 00:50:23,743
- Out!
- <i>Nice one!</i>

866
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:25,661
- <i>They weren't ready at all.</i>
- <i>That's right.</i>

867
00:50:25,745 --> 00:50:28,164
{\an8}- That's the first punch tactic.
- Land it to win.

868
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:30,041
{\an8}Ki-baek seems to be
in good spirits today.

869
00:50:30,124 --> 00:50:31,000
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

870
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:36,923
{\an8}I'M THE TEAM'S ACE!

871
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:38,883
{\an8}<i>PN caught the ball. And shoot!</i>

872
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:41,594
- <i>Ki-baek dodged. Dong-hyeok is out.</i>
- Out!

873
00:50:41,677 --> 00:50:44,514
- Yes!
- <i>Team Men on the Run has scored a point.</i>

874
00:50:44,597 --> 00:50:46,432
<i>It's not looking good for Team Donkeys.</i>

875
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:48,226
<i>Oh? What?</i>

876
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:49,685
{\an8}He looked at the camera.

877
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:52,188
{\an8}That finger heart.
That's why he's the team's ace.

878
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:53,481
{\an8}Let's go!

879
00:50:54,232 --> 00:50:55,066
{\an8}KEEP THE MOMENTUM

880
00:50:55,149 --> 00:50:56,901
{\an8}LET'S GO

881
00:51:04,075 --> 00:51:05,368
<i>Song Ki-baek has the ball.</i>

882
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:07,745
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>What's with that look on his face?</i>

883
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:10,957
<i>Hang on. He has crazy eyes right now.</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>

884
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,879
<i>The ball left Crazy Eyes' hands.</i>

885
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:19,048
- <i>Shoot!</i>
- <i>Shoot!</i>

886
00:51:21,676 --> 00:51:22,677
Save!

887
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:24,846
Wow, I survived.

888
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:27,056
<i>Kim Ung-min throws.</i>
<i>Is he after Song Ki-baek?</i>

889
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,059
<i>Not a chance. Song Ki-baek looks around</i>
<i>and selects his target.</i>

890
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,896
<i>Hold on. Song Ki-baek jumped.</i>
<i>He's floating in the air!</i>

891
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,067
<i>Kang Ho-jun, Kang Seung-beom. Oh, PN!</i>
<i>That's the second headshot.</i>

892
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:40,403
Oh!

893
00:51:40,486 --> 00:51:41,946
- Save!
- <i>It's a save.</i>

894
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:42,947
Damn it.

895
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,324
<i>PN looks very upset right now.</i>

896
00:51:45,408 --> 00:51:46,784
<i>Is he all right?</i>

897
00:51:51,247 --> 00:51:52,248
Relax. Easy.

898
00:51:52,331 --> 00:51:53,499
Right. Sure thing.

899
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:55,710
<i>"Hey, relax." He lectured him.</i>

900
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:57,795
<i>He only did that to throw him off.</i>

901
00:51:57,879 --> 00:52:00,298
<i>Oh! Song Ki-baek got the ball again.</i>

902
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:06,095
<i>That's…</i>

903
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:09,557
- <i>That is the deadly fire shot!</i>
- Wait.

904
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:11,893
<i>PN is knocked out!</i>

905
00:52:14,145 --> 00:52:16,063
Line crossed. Switch turns!

906
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:21,152
- Hey, don't worry about it.
- Too bad. All right.

907
00:52:21,235 --> 00:52:22,111
Let's go get them.

908
00:52:22,195 --> 00:52:23,112
- All right.
- Okay.

909
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:26,491
I told you to bring a variety show star,
not the Dodgeball King.

910
00:52:26,574 --> 00:52:29,452
He's done three headshots
just today alone.

911
00:52:30,036 --> 00:52:30,912
What's with him?

912
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:33,080
No, I'm good. I don't need it.

913
00:52:33,164 --> 00:52:35,958
The cameras are rolling.
Why won't he drink the tea?

914
00:52:36,042 --> 00:52:37,668
Did you give him the sponsored products?

915
00:52:37,752 --> 00:52:40,129
- Well, I did.
- Okay.

916
00:52:40,213 --> 00:52:42,423
He thanked me and took extra products.

917
00:52:43,216 --> 00:52:46,135
Why? So he could have them at home?

918
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:49,430
- What's his deal? Min-gu.
- Yes.

919
00:52:49,514 --> 00:52:50,681
Can we take a break?

920
00:52:50,765 --> 00:52:52,767
We'll take a short break.

921
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,519
I'll talk to him. Tidy up here.

922
00:52:55,603 --> 00:52:57,813
- We're doing pretty well.
- Did that hurt earlier?

923
00:52:57,897 --> 00:52:58,856
Ki-baek.

924
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,899
Can we have a chat?

925
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:01,400
- Sorry?
- Just a chat.

926
00:53:01,484 --> 00:53:03,402
Why? Oh, because I did so well.

927
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:04,362
I'll be right back.

928
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:13,913
Hello.

929
00:53:23,923 --> 00:53:26,551
{\an8}HIGH VOLTAGE
KEEP OUT

930
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:28,970
HIGH VOLTAGE
DO NOT TOUCH WITH BARE HANDS

931
00:53:35,977 --> 00:53:37,853
Ki-baek. Are you the Dodgeball King?

932
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:42,525
Do you know the main theme of the show?

933
00:53:42,608 --> 00:53:46,529
A men's ball game, a showdown.
"Let's play together and have fun."

934
00:53:46,612 --> 00:53:47,697
Yes, exactly.

935
00:53:48,864 --> 00:53:51,701
Ball game, a showdown.
I think I'm doing a good job.

936
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:54,412
No. What you said after that is
the most important part.

937
00:53:54,495 --> 00:53:57,456
"Let's play together and have fun."

938
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,000
You're doing it all by yourself.

939
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:02,712
Nothing's more important than chemistry
between cast members on a variety show.

940
00:54:03,796 --> 00:54:05,214
Oh, team play.

941
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:07,633
I think I'm doing well on that front too.

942
00:54:07,717 --> 00:54:10,428
Forget it. Why do you keep targeting PN?

943
00:54:10,511 --> 00:54:11,345
His head, at that.

944
00:54:11,429 --> 00:54:13,973
We usually show PN's close-up
before the commercial break.

945
00:54:14,056 --> 00:54:16,183
At this rate, it'll begin
right after the headshot.

946
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:18,686
That's because he's usually in the center.

947
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:21,022
That's right. Why do you think that is?

948
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:23,149
From the uniforms
to the lunch you guys had,

949
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:26,110
PN's fans and the advertisers
prepared everything.

950
00:54:26,694 --> 00:54:27,528
Oh…

951
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:31,115
I guess I didn't know
how things worked on the show.

952
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:35,870
Oh, please. You know enough about showbiz.

953
00:54:35,953 --> 00:54:38,748
If you keep doing this,
people will call you an amateur.

954
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:45,504
Even so, I am not an amateur.

955
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:06,859
<i>You excel at everything.</i>

956
00:55:06,942 --> 00:55:09,111
You call this a news anchor?

957
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:10,946
<i>Can you cover my shift? Mr. Kim said…</i>

958
00:55:30,383 --> 00:55:31,884
What is this? What's going on?

959
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:33,552
What's going on?

960
00:55:33,636 --> 00:55:34,470
Is the power out?

961
00:55:34,553 --> 00:55:36,639
What? Why would the power go out?

962
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:43,187
Mr. Song Ki-baek.

963
00:55:45,356 --> 00:55:47,733
Please wake up.

964
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:50,444
Mr. Song!

965
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,405
Yes?

966
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:56,784
Ki-baek, are you all right?

967
00:55:58,244 --> 00:56:01,122
My God. Are you okay?

968
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:02,206
Yes, I'm all right.

969
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:03,457
Are you really okay?

970
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:05,251
There were electric sparks everywhere.

971
00:56:05,334 --> 00:56:07,336
Who knew I'd see someone get
an electric shock?

972
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,797
Are you really all right? You're okay?

973
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,340
No, I'm not okay!

974
00:56:19,932 --> 00:56:21,100
What are you doing here?

975
00:56:21,183 --> 00:56:23,853
The power's out in the whole building.
Come out. Hurry!

976
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:29,734
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?
I think you just had an electric shock.

977
00:56:29,817 --> 00:56:31,402
No, I feel fine physically,

978
00:56:31,485 --> 00:56:33,988
but I'm getting a headache
because you're so loud.

979
00:56:36,157 --> 00:56:37,158
I mean… Ma'am?

980
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,288
You're not getting out?

981
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:44,415
Ma'am? You're not getting out?

982
00:57:02,725 --> 00:57:04,810
Why did the power suddenly go out?

983
00:57:05,478 --> 00:57:07,605
Well, some stuff happened.

984
00:57:07,688 --> 00:57:09,690
- Did you call Facility Management?
- Yes.

985
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:11,776
- I called them.
- It's so damn hot today.

986
00:57:12,443 --> 00:57:14,320
Do you want something to drink?

987
00:57:14,403 --> 00:57:15,571
Took you long enough.

988
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:18,157
Are you messing with me?

989
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,241
Don't you have something cold?

990
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:20,868
And what are you waiting for?

991
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:22,620
I feel so hot! Go get the umbrella.

992
00:57:22,703 --> 00:57:24,455
I'll get a sunburn on my face!

993
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:25,748
Okay.

994
00:57:26,499 --> 00:57:27,500
Jesus Christ.

995
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:30,127
PN is so cranky right now.

996
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:32,505
What if he loses it
and throws a crazy tantrum?

997
00:57:32,588 --> 00:57:34,632
And here I thought
he was behaving himself.

998
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:37,718
Oh, Ki-baek.

999
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:38,636
Over here.

1000
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:42,681
I knew you'd cause trouble.

1001
00:57:42,765 --> 00:57:45,059
What the heck did you do
to make the power go out?

1002
00:57:45,142 --> 00:57:47,269
It's always a nobody who causes trouble.

1003
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:48,479
Loser.

1004
00:57:49,063 --> 00:57:50,439
<i>Loser.</i>

1005
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:55,319
What? Why is that loser standing there?

1006
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,828
Are you trying to get my attention?

1007
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:05,621
Then you really are--

1008
00:58:05,704 --> 00:58:06,831
No, I'm not.

1009
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,585
Hey. You can't stand me, right?

1010
00:58:11,669 --> 00:58:12,837
Yes!

1011
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:15,756
No.

1012
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,174
I mean, no.

1013
00:58:17,258 --> 00:58:18,926
Oh, this guy is funny.

1014
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:23,180
Oh, I see. You want to be my friend
because you want the spotlight.

1015
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:25,182
I could help you if you'd like.

1016
00:58:25,266 --> 00:58:26,433
Then how about…

1017
00:58:28,477 --> 00:58:31,063
you do as I say? All right?

1018
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:33,983
That's how it works here.

1019
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:36,944
There are many eyes watching,
so don't fight here.

1020
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:38,779
- I-na, take Ki-baek.
- Just avoid him.

1021
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:40,990
Come here, PN. Let's talk.

1022
00:58:41,073 --> 00:58:41,907
Talk about what?

1023
00:58:41,991 --> 00:58:43,701
Let's just go.

1024
00:58:43,784 --> 00:58:45,161
No, I don't want to.

1025
00:58:45,244 --> 00:58:48,164
I'll chew that jerk to pieces today…

1026
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:52,877
Please calm down.

1027
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,211
He keeps provoking me.

1028
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:56,755
- Calm down--
- Damn you! What are you doing?

1029
00:58:56,839 --> 00:58:59,008
I did nothing wrong, okay?

1030
00:58:59,091 --> 00:59:00,384
Min-gu!

1031
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:02,386
No, it's not that.

1032
00:59:05,431 --> 00:59:07,600
I'm sorry, PN. My apologies.

1033
00:59:07,683 --> 00:59:11,020
Loser. He's apologizing again.

1034
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,898
Park Jin-bok!

1035
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:21,614
Park Jin-bok?

1036
00:59:21,697 --> 00:59:23,741
He hates it when someone
says his real name.

1037
00:59:23,824 --> 00:59:25,201
We're screwed.

1038
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:33,042
Why did you apologize?

1039
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:35,377
Have you lost your mind?

1040
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:39,089
I thought you were a clown,
but are you just plain crazy?

1041
00:59:39,673 --> 00:59:41,342
Hey! Forget about the shoot.

1042
00:59:43,427 --> 00:59:46,055
Get this psycho out of my sight!

1043
00:59:47,473 --> 00:59:49,141
Get your act together!

1044
00:59:49,225 --> 00:59:51,518
Everyone you see right now
is here to work.

1045
00:59:51,602 --> 00:59:55,731
No one came here to be harassed
by a crazy bastard like you!

1046
00:59:55,814 --> 00:59:58,859
Do you think everyone's a joke
because they let you have your way?

1047
00:59:59,443 --> 01:00:00,986
- Let go, okay?
- Park Jin-bok!

1048
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:02,821
What should we do?

1049
01:00:02,905 --> 01:00:04,740
Jin-bok can't fight. Just leave them be.

1050
01:00:04,823 --> 01:00:05,783
You!

1051
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:08,661
You're successful because of your fans.

1052
01:00:08,744 --> 01:00:13,123
If you remain such an ingrate,
someone will screw you over.

1053
01:00:13,207 --> 01:00:15,876
You deserve to get screwed over, big-time!

1054
01:00:17,711 --> 01:00:20,047
Just one slap in the face from me,

1055
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,049
and you'll turn over a new leaf.

1056
01:00:22,633 --> 01:00:24,301
You rude bastard!

1057
01:00:24,385 --> 01:00:25,636
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

1058
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:31,392
- What?
- Oh, no. Woo-ju!

1059
01:00:37,273 --> 01:00:39,108
- What is this?
- Have you lost your mind?

1060
01:00:39,191 --> 01:00:42,444
What… What's happening?

1061
01:00:42,528 --> 01:00:43,821
What?

1062
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:45,739
No, no way. Trust me.

1063
01:00:45,823 --> 01:00:48,409
This can't be.

1064
01:00:48,492 --> 01:00:49,618
No, no. No way!

1065
01:00:49,702 --> 01:00:51,328
This has got to be a lie.

1066
01:00:51,954 --> 01:00:55,040
This is all a lie!

1067
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:24,194
FRANKLY SPEAKING

1068

{\an8}<i>You've changed. You're acting strange.</i>

1069

{\an8}<i>So I can't say what I don't mean.</i>

1070
01:01:29,658 --> 01:01:30,659
{\an8}<i>Does this even make sense?</i>

1071
01:01:32,578 --> 01:01:34,705
{\an8}<i>I respect you? No, I don't.</i>

1072

{\an8}<i>This is so damn stressful.</i>

1073
01:01:37,082 --> 01:01:38,876
{\an8}- Get out, moron!

1074

{\an8}<i>Song Ki-baek. I'm worried.</i>

1075

1076

{\an8}It's dangerous!

1077
01:01:49,386 --> 01:01:51,055

1078
