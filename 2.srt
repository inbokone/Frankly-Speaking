Park Jin-bok!

6
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:09,546
Have you lost your mind?

7
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:11,006
Hey! Forget about the shoot.

8
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:13,342
Get this psycho out of my sight!

9
00:01:13,342 --> 00:01:14,343
Get your act together!

10
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,345
Everyone you see right now
is here to work.

11
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:18,597
No one came here to be harassed!

12
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:19,681
You rude bastard!

13
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,891
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

14
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:29,316
- What is this?
- What?

15
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:32,569
What... What's happening?

16
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:36,281
- This can't be happening. It can't be.
- Have you lost your mind?

17
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:37,783
No, no way.

18
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:41,036
Unbelievable. He just went
and bit his head off.

19
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,496
What is he, a shark?

20
00:01:42,496 --> 00:01:44,748
This is all a lie!

21
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:47,918
EPISODE 2: SHARK IN A POOL

22
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,387
{\an8}Currently, the KOSPI stands
at 2,697.58 points,

23
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:02,516
{\an8}marking a decrease of 9.44 points
from the previous trading session.

24
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:05,227
{\an8}Meanwhile, the KOSDAQ
is showing a slight uptick,

25
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:08,564
{\an8}rising by 0.66 points
to reach 923.62 points.

26
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:10,816
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

27
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,818
- Hey. You can't stand me, right?
- Yes!

28
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:15,070
I'll chew that jerk to pieces today...

29
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,363
Get your act together!

30
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,744
A non-soft cookie from the land
of non-soft cookies wanted to become

31
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:25,956
a soft cookie and traveled to the land
of soft cookies.

32
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,792
The gatekeeper of the soft cookie land
said, "Hey, kid, today..."

33
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:30,502
Just one slap in the face from me,

34
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:31,879
and you'll turn over a new leaf.

35
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,506
You rude bastard!

36
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,968
Why on earth did he do that?

37
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:39,303
It is truly hard to believe.

38
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:42,681
Let's hear from Mr. Song Ki-baek
who was at the scene.

39
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:43,932
Just why...

40
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:47,269
Why in God's name

41
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:54,943
did you speak your thoughts out loud?

42
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:59,615
A CLEAN BODY
LEADS TO A HEALTHY MIND

43
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:17,466
Time to get to work
so Mr. Kim can tear me a new one.

44
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,469
What did I just say?

45
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,846
Man, what's wrong with me?

46
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,934
{\an8}That Song Ki-baek. Song Ki-baek!

47
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:29,102
Let's recap. So what happened was--

48
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:34,900
Song Ki-baek tore into PN
with both verbal and non-verbal violence.

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,779
PN now claims to be suffering
from extremely severe PTSD as a result

50
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,907
and has provided a doctor's note stating
he can no longer be in our show.

51
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:45,035
What are the chances
of PN coming back after recovery?

52
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:47,079
He wants to gracefully leave the show.

53
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,121
Oh, yeah?

54
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:51,124
Then we should also
gracefully leave the show.

55
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,376
I'll go talk to PN.

56
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:55,379
We can't afford to be graceful like him.

57
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,631
We have to be pathetic
and beg him to stay.

58
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,550
- I'll come with you.
- No thanks.

59
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,594
You stay here
and take care of what you can.

60
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:05,264
Maybe I should go like this.

61
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:07,683
I've been crawling
and begging to so many people.

62
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:12,479
Don't try too hard.

63
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:14,773
How can I not?

64
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:16,566
The crew might lose their jobs.

65
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:19,653
I'll crawl if that's what it takes.

66
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,698
Hey, Song Ki-baek! Song...

67
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:24,700
Where is he? Where's that bastard?

68
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,201
Has he run away? Where's...

69
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,327
Where is Song Ki-baek?

70
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:29,871
Yoon Ji-hu! Where is that bastard?

71
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:32,374
I'm going to kill him and go to hell.
Bring him to me.

72
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:34,668
I've got a shoot
for <i>Pyororong Witch School.</i>

73
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:35,877
Huh? You have what?

74
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,004
A shoot, sir.

75
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:39,548
Hey, you little... Take that thing off.

76
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:41,091
Hey! Where's Song Ki-baek...

77
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:43,677
Tell me where he... Hey!

78
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:44,803
<i>Mr. Kim is throwing a fit.</i>

79
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:47,014
<i>Don't come here. Hide somewhere for a bit.</i>

80
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:50,017
"Don't come here"? "Hide somewhere"?

81
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:51,518
Oh, man. What am I going to do?

82
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:55,564
Oh, he's calling me. What do I do?

83
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:59,735
It's been a while. Taking a smoke break?

84
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:04,323
Hey, Ki-baek doesn't smoke.
He's doing the anti-smoking campaign.

85
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:05,324
Oh, wow.

86
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,367
It's only been a week or so
since I quit.

87
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:13,790
You smell like an ashtray.
Please take care of that.

88
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:16,918
No, I didn't mean that. I...

89
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:20,255
NO MORE STINKY BREATH!

90
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:30,766
Wow. He's thoughtfully rude.

91
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:34,978
Hey, Ki-baek!

92
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,689
Mr. Kim is looking for you
with lasers shooting out of his eyes.

93
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,024
What's going on?

94
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:41,068
Hold on, wait. Are you free?

95
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,820
- Can you fill in for me for a dubbing job?
- Don't do that.

96
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,072
Oh, no, sir.

97
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:46,365
What?

98
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:48,700
Don't worry, man.

99
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,869
- I'll talk to them and make sure--
- No!

100
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:53,872
All you do is talk trash about people.

101
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:56,166
Do you think I don't know how
you pass off tiresome tasks

102
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:00,712
to your juniors and then gripe
about them doing a crappy job.

103
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:04,716
Ki-baek, I have a favor to ask.

104
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:07,594
No favors.

105
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:09,429
No! No more favors!

106
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:12,099
And no more green juice!

107
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,334
<i>Enjoying a cup of tea with my heart.</i>

108
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:42,420
<i>Happiness comes from these little moments.</i>

109
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,590
I'm hungry.

110
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,972
Did you know? It's already corn season.

111
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,224
- Huh?
- The hairdresser downstairs gave me some.

112
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:55,934
Aren't they huge?

113
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:57,769
Come on, I don't want corn.

114
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:59,229
Let's order in, Mom.

115
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:04,359
- How about Yupdduk?
- Oh! Order a super spicy one!

116
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:07,696
You have no problem ordering delivery
when you don't even make a penny.

117
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:10,490
The corn is nice and chewy.

118
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,118
I'm in pain, so Yupdduk?

119
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,078
- Come on, Yupdduk.
- Knock it off.

120
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,830
I'm going to the gym.

121
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,040
Didn't you say today was your day off?

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,876
You teach people how to work out,

123
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:23,253
and you want to work out
on your day off too?

124
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:24,171
Oh, stop it.

125
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,423
I've got to work out myself
because it's my day off.

126
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:28,258
Come on, Mom. Let's have Yupdduk.

127
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:30,093
I'll make you rice cake soup for dinner.

128
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:31,136
It isn't the same.

129
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,721
Hey!

130
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:33,972
See you later.

131
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:36,141
You're taking all the eggs again?

132
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,727
I peeled them to make jangjorim.

133
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,064
Goodness! Let me get you some cold water.

134
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,065
Oh, forget it.

135
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:48,111
Didn't you notice it's steaming hot?
Maybe you need glasses.

136
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,321
Oh, please.

137
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,114
You good-for-nothing.

138
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:54,618
You're staring at your phone
when your mom's tongue is on fire?

139
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:58,121
No way. Mom, Dad. Look at this.

140
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,959
IDOL SINGER P
ASSAULTED BY ANNOUNCER S

141
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:06,338
{\an8}It's not too bad, right?

142
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,131
{\an8}This works best when you want to hide.

143
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:10,759
{\an8}So what happened anyway?

144
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,346
{\an8}Why'd you do something so wild that it
made the news and made Mr. Kim flip out?

145
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:19,142
{\an8}Why do you keep making the news
instead of reporting it?

146
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:20,852
Oh, whatever. Stop asking questions.

147
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:23,230
How do you film in this thing?

148
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,356
I can't breathe.

149
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:26,024
{\an8}You get used to it.

150
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:29,361
{\an8}I even ran around in the hospital
with Sol yesterday wearing this.

151
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,113
{\an8}- She's back in the hospital?
- Just for a few days for some tests.

152
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:33,949
{\an8}Sol is fine.

153
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:35,534
{\an8}You should worry about yourself.

154
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:39,955
Are you planning on going freelance?

155
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,915
Trying to leave
while you're in the limelight?

156
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:43,083
{\an8}That's ridiculous!

157
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,460
{\an8}It's not that.

158
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,545
All right then.

159
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:49,839
I'd better get to the shoot
for "<i>Pororong.</i>"

160
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,133
{\an8}"Pyo-ro-rong."

161
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,593
What's your problem?

162
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:57,055
It's "pyororong"
as in <i>Pyororong Witch School</i>,

163
00:08:57,055 --> 00:09:00,058
not "pororong"
as in <i>Pororo the Little Penguin.</i>

164
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:01,726
Can't you say "pyo" instead of "po"?

165
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:03,520
Fine.

166
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:06,815
I'm off to shoot <i>Pyororong Witch School.</i>

167
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,068
I'll take this with me.

168
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:22,372
ANNOUNCER S
CAUSES SCENE DURING SHOOT

169
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:26,251
This is obviously me.

170
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:29,462
Oh, she...

171
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:31,756
WRITER ON WOO-JU

172
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,344
Why won't you answer your phone?

173
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:39,806
Because I don't want to.

174
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:42,517
{\an8}JBC NEWS AT NOON

175
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:44,894
{\an8}Mr. Song Ki-baek, please come with me.

176
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:46,896
All I can do is just beg PN to stay,

177
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:49,065
but you're the one who caused all this.

178
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:51,359
If we lose PN,
it'll be the end of our show.

179
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,320
The jerk is the one who should apologize.

180
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,113
Are you really going to be like this?

181
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:58,241
I understand your logic, Ms. On.

182
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:00,368
Considering his influence,

183
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,371
I agree that this is an issue
that must be solved.

184
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:04,414
So you get it.

185
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:06,291
The hell I do!

186
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:16,217
Did you not know PN was a horrible person
who treats people like crap?

187
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:17,510
There's no way you didn't.

188
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,432
You just pretended not to and enjoyed
the free stuff and advertisers he brought.

189
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:24,517
Is it okay to be an ass if you're a star?

190
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:29,147
What else can we do?

191
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:32,776
You think we can just be like,
"Well, he got what he deserved."

192
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:35,862
Look, the entire crew's livelihood
is at stake here.

193
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:37,697
Don't talk like this is a simple matter.

194
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:39,574
I'm not. It's hard for me to say this.

195
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,327
But I can't apologize to him.

196
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,873
Mr. Song Ki-baek.
You're really not going to apologize?

197
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:50,752
It's not that I won't. I really can't.

198
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:52,379
Right now, I'm in a state...

199
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:56,383
- What do you mean?
- Back off!

200
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,218
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

201
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:03,390
What am I going to do?

202
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,891
What do I do about this?

203
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,441
Wow. Was I wrong about you?

204
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:14,567
Ki-baek, seriously!

205
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,653
Hey, is something going on with you?

206
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:19,864
I never thought you, of all people,
would do something like this.

207
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:22,951
Have you always had trouble
controlling your emotions?

208
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:25,120
KIM SANG-JIN

209
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,037
KIM JERK

210
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:27,247
Say something!

211
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,585
<i>Don't break the absolute rules</i>

212
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:35,338
<i>Don't let go of my hand</i>

213
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:37,090
<i>Unity is my weapon</i>

214
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,217
<i>Walk towards the wilderness</i>

00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,344
<i>I know that's your home ground</i>

216
00:11:41,344 --> 00:11:43,138
<i>Stand up to the threat</i>

217
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:44,472
Push past it, push past it!

218
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,975
I'm listening, sir.

219
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:49,769
Get it together, man.

220
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,813
Just go for now.

221
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:54,482
Hey, Song Ki-baek.

222
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:58,611
That's him, guys.

223
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:01,364
Hey, you're the one who attacked
my sweet PN, right?

224
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:02,615
Let's kick his ass!

225
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:04,909
- You, apologize to him!
- Come on, guys!

226
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,995
- Hey!
- Hey!

227
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:11,082
What?

228
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:13,835
- There he is!
- Hey!

229
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,838
That's Ki-baek. Hi, Ki-baek.

230
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,339
- We meet again.
- Come out here.

231
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,550
- Get out of the car!
- Watch out, guys.

232
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:24,095
God.

233
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:28,850
Man, seriously.

234
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,268
{\an8}HANGUK MILK

235
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:35,315
You've got to have
strawberry milk with soju.

236
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:40,153
Jesus. I have better things to do
than fetch you milk, you know.

237
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,280
Those jerks.

238
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:44,324
They wouldn't even let you see him?

239
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:49,162
I waited two hours in front of PN's agency
and three hours in front of his house.

240
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:53,833
You should've known
when to give up and leave.

241
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,418
Man, you're an idiot.

242
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,961
Think our show will be canceled?

243
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:58,296
It's already been canceled.

244
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:01,049
They made the final decision just now.

245
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,467
We need to leave the office.

246
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:05,887
To be honest, I've always felt guilty.

247
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:09,224
Every time we heard PN yelling
at the staff and saw them crying,

248
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:12,060
we pretended like we didn't see it.

249
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:15,063
Well, what could we have done?

250
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:17,815
Fly at his throat like Song Ki-baek did?

251
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:20,527
We might not have been able
to fly at his throat,

252
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,238
but if this is how
things were going to turn out,

253
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:29,077
perhaps I shouldn't have lashed out
at Song Ki-baek to make him apologize.

My goodness.

00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,143
Sweetheart. What on earth is going on?

263
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:36,311
Did you get my text?

264
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,146
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

265
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:42,775
You won't even say hello to your brother?

266
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:43,902
Hey, man.

267
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:52,660
What's this?

268
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:57,415
LET ME STAY HERE TONIGHT

00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:05,548
<i>It may be uncomfortable,
but you'll have to make do.</i>

<i>I'll clear out the room in the morning.</i>

271
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:10,929
What's up with Ki-baek?

272
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:13,473
What do you think?
You saw the news, didn't you?

273
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:17,143
"Mr. S who assaulted an idol." That's him.

274
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:20,730
People may not know,
but I recognized him right away.

275
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,191
Because they did a crappy job
blurring out his face.

276
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:24,734
My poor Ki-baek.

277
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:26,861
He just went in there
without saying a word.

278
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,656
He must be feeling terrible.

279
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:31,074
Oh, boy.

280
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:35,745
But he's supposed to give me
my allowance today.

281
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:38,456
Can I ask for just another 100,000 won?

282
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:39,582
Are you kidding?

283
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:41,709
Don't you dare say a word.

284
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:46,047
I have to ask him for money
for our living expenses today.

285
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:57,016
Ki-baek, wake up.

286
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,769
Hey. Come out here for a second.

287
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:01,771
What...

288
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,191
What are you doing?

289
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:10,113
I know you're going through
something at work,

290
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:14,492
but why would you just drop in like this?
You're making everyone tiptoe around you.

291
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:16,285
What are you doing? Stop it.

292
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,996
Huh? For God's sake,

293
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,498
take off the mask!

294
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:23,668
What the heck?

295
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:26,295
Have you gone crazy?

296
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:29,465
Ki-baek. What's going on with you?

297
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:33,302
Ouch! That must hurt.

298
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:34,679
Ki-baek.

299
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,848
I don't know what happened,

300
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:38,641
but let's sit down and talk.

301
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:39,934
Oh, for God's sake!

302
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:42,520
Just leave me alone, will you?

303
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,064
I don't need your consolation. Okay?

304
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:46,566
Don't treat me any differently.

305
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,568
You wouldn't even care if I died.

306
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:51,154
All you care about
is the money I give you.

307
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:54,240
Ki-baek! If that's how you're going to be,
go back in there.

308
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:59,662
Just leave me the hell alone!

309
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:01,247
Damn it.

310
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:03,958
You've never bothered to visit us before.

311
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,419
You're only here
because you've got nowhere to go.

312
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,337
And you don't pay
for everything around here.

313
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:09,922
Don't be so patronizing about--

314
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,549
What? Patronizing?

315
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,551
What? Am I wrong?

316
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,970
You've always acted like
you're the only adult!

317
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,265
You're a 30-year-old man
who's barely making ends meet,

318
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:21,059
so don't you preach to me!

319
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,727
What? You little...

320
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:24,187
Enough!

321
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,486
Stop it. That's enough.

322
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,251
Hey.

323
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:30,628
You actually came.

324
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,755
You told me to.

325
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:34,757
Still, I didn't think you'd show up,

326
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:37,218
especially after bolting
like that earlier.

327
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:40,346
So did you meet with PN?

328
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,141
He wouldn't see me.

329
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,560
I waited five hours.

330
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,315
Listen, Ms. On Woo-ju.

331
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:52,608
Thank you.

332
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:58,364
I've wished at least a hundred times
that I could punch PN.

333
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:04,120
I knew all about how he only bullied
the young and powerless staff members.

334
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:08,124
I'm the head writer,

335
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:14,380
but all I did was tell them to let it go
and I'd talk to him later.

336
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:22,305
Anyway, thanks for beating him up
when I couldn't.

337
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:23,931
"Beat him up"? I didn't...

338
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:29,103
You totally beat him up with your words,
and it felt great to see that.

339
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:31,105
Are you always like that?

340
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,524
I mean, is that okay? You're an anchor.

341
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,570
No, I'm not always like that.

342
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,907
It's been driving me totally crazy
since yesterday.

343
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:44,076
Yesterday?

344
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,330
Hey, hang on.

345
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,292
Wash it down with this.

346
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:53,336
Oh, I'm good.

347
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,295
Just try it.

348
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:56,756
Bitter and sweet,
they're a perfect pair. Here.

349
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,180
I'm not drunk, you know.

350
00:20:05,264 --> 00:20:06,432
I hope not.

351
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:08,643
I'm telling you. I'm not drunk.

352
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:31,582
You're going to sleep out here?

353
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:33,542
Come on, you'll get in a lot of trouble.

354
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:37,463
Listen. Give me your address.
I'll call you a cab.

355
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:41,801
Okay? Your address.

356
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:46,222
Oh, boy.

357
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:36,022
She'll be all right.

358
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,526
She can't expect me
to stay with her all night.

359
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:46,657
I'll be going then.

360
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:49,785
Excuse me.

361
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:54,707
Shouldn't we film a final episode?

362
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:57,877
The show's been on for two years.
We should say goodbye to the viewers.

363
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,504
People don't do that anymore.

364
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:02,882
Our ratings have been down
for a while now.

365
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:05,259
Let's just accept
that this is the end of it.

366
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:06,969
Let's start on the next one.

367
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,848
- Your greenroom is this way.
- Okay.

368
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:13,309
See? My greenroom is upstairs. Come here.

369
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:15,227
What is it?

370
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:17,104
What's up with them?

371
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:20,149
One of their cast screwed up,
and their show is being canceled.

372
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:21,359
No way.

373
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,110
- It's true.
- What?

374
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,906
I hear this was their first show.
They probably won't get another chance.

375
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:30,326
You should be careful too. Okay?

376
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:32,078
- I'll see you upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah.

377
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:43,756
I respect you...

378
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:46,008
No, I don't.

379
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:48,928
Let's try one syllable at a time.

380
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:51,555
This is

381
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,767
so damn stressful.

382
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:00,731
Man. I'm sorry.

383
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:07,071
Everything was

384
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,323
not my fault.

385
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,369
That's right. It wasn't all my fault.

386
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:18,290
It seems I can't bring myself
to say what I don't mean,

387
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,417
which is just ridiculous.

388
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:25,798
MR. KIM

389
00:23:26,382 --> 00:23:29,260
Don't be so upset about it, all right?

390
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,889
You were going to leave <i>News at Noon</i>
to audition for the main news show anyway.

391
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:38,060
Just think of this as a little break.

392
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:41,355
Here, you want candy?

393
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:46,193
By the way, I just don't understand
no matter how hard I try.

394
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:47,444
Why did you do that?

395
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:49,196
This isn't your first day on the job.

396
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:50,739
With your experience,

397
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:53,868
I'm sure you know better than
to cause a scene in public.

398
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:57,371
You're not like the other guys
who get into trouble for their temper.

399
00:23:57,371 --> 00:24:00,082
I wouldn't be so curious
if it was anybody else.

400
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:02,042
I just can't help wondering.

401
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,212
Damn.

402
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:08,007
Oh! Hey, the brand awards.

403
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:09,383
You should host it.

404
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:12,094
Park Jin-u was supposed to do it,
but he was in a car accident.

405
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:14,680
They wanted me
to get back to them by today,

406
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,806
and you're not busy.

407
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:18,058
You'll be taking a long break.

408
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,853
Since you're taking a break,
do this for me.

409
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:22,521
Okay! Good.

410
00:24:23,105 --> 00:24:26,066
Take a nice, long break, okay?
Just take a break and think.

411
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:30,654
Use this break to reflect on yourself
and really use your brain, you know.

412
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:32,656
Why do you keep calling it a break?

413
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:36,410
I'll still have to come to work
where you breathe down my neck.

414
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,829
It's a punishment.
You'll dump all the menial jobs on me.

415
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:40,706
Excuse me?

416
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:42,917
Also, did you step in poop
on your way here?

417
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,793
- Poop?
- Don't you know your feet stink?

418
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:53,594
Mr. Kim, hello. Oh.

419
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:01,894
Lastly, I know this is a bad time,

420
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:04,772
but I really want to audition
for the main news show.

421
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:06,732
The main news show? Are you kidding?

422
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:08,692
Your name was taken off
the list ages ago.

423
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:12,404
Are you dense or just thoughtless?

424
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:13,656
Get out, you moron!

425
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:15,991
I'll make you pay for this.

426
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:17,451
I swear.

427
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:19,245
Make me pay?

428
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:21,747
Ki-Baek.

429
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:24,667
What are you doing?

430
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:32,174
Hey, let him talk. Keep going.

431
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:34,718
Say what? You swear you'll what?

432
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,887
I swear...

433
00:25:39,556 --> 00:25:41,475
I'm sorry. Oh?

434
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:43,102
I'm sorry. Oh.

435
00:25:43,102 --> 00:25:44,186
Oh.

436
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:47,481
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

437
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:53,946
Bye.

438
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:57,700
He's been acting like a lunatic
since he went on your show.

439
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,576
What happened to him over there?

440
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:02,621
Well, I'm not really sure,

441
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:05,040
but he certainly seems a little weird...

442
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,125
Hey.

443
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:10,045
Mr. Song Ki-baek.

444
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:17,594
I got home very safely last night,
thanks to you.

445
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:19,680
Right, I'm glad.

446
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,015
Hey, listen.

447
00:26:21,724 --> 00:26:23,809
Did you see a doctor
after the electric shock?

448
00:26:24,393 --> 00:26:25,519
No.

449
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,771
You said you've been feeling weird.

450
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:30,649
Shouldn't you go see
a psychiatrist or a neurologist?

451
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:35,446
People know who I am,
and I'm a little self-conscious.

452
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:37,698
What kind of nonsense is that?

453
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:40,159
This may be a serious problem.

454
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,410
Let's go to the hospital.

455
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,620
- No, I'm not going.
- For God's sake.

456
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:47,750
Come on. I'll buy you tonkatsu.

457
00:26:57,968 --> 00:26:59,845
He's the doctor
I tried to get on our show.

458
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:02,806
He promised to keep things
as private as possible.

459
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:12,608
Hello, doctor.

460
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,485
Have a seat.

461
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:18,030
Didn't we say we'd meet
at the outpatient clinic after lunchtime?

462
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:21,950
I'm sorry. I'm trying not to be seen
by many people.

463
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:24,870
Please go on and eat. There's no rush.

464
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,038
Oh, right. Yeah.

465
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:31,960
Can someone's personality change
after being electrocuted?

466
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,672
Like I said on the phone,
I'll have to run some tests to be sure.

467
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:37,549
Don't worry about it until we know more.

468
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:40,511
I got myself in trouble
before I could even start to worry.

469
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:44,807
Wait a minute. You look familiar.
Is he... He is, right?

470
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:49,311
See? I told you he'd still recognize me.

471
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:50,562
- Yes, I'm--
- A singer.

472
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:52,064
- Oh.
- Oh.

473
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:55,317
A news anchor.

474
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:56,944
Wow, I'm embarrassed for you.

475
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:58,695
That's why you looked so familiar.

476
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:00,656
I'm a fan.

477
00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:16,296
One plus one is...

478
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:18,674
Five. Oh!

479
00:28:19,842 --> 00:28:20,759
I did it.

480
00:28:21,385 --> 00:28:22,761
Oh, I did it.

481
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:24,471
I did it.

482
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:29,017
This is all because of stress.
Stress is the cause.

483
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,521
I'm okay. I'm okay now.

484
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,401
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

485

486

00:28:44,908 --> 00:28:47,995
MCST ANNOUNCES NEW PLAN TO BOOST
CONSUMPTION FOR FAMILY MONTH

488
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:53,459
I see a future full of hope ahead of me.

489
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,296
I did it.

490
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:04,470
I'm rich. I'm the best anchor there is.

491
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:07,765
I'm okay.

492
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:11,935
I'm back to normal.

BRAND AWARDS CEREMONY

499
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:41,799
Ladies and gentlemen. Good

500
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,051
evening.

501
00:29:55,562 --> 00:29:57,314
- Hello. Oh, hi.
- Hello.

502
00:29:57,314 --> 00:29:59,608
- Jeong-heon, stay healthy.
- Thank you.

503
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:02,110
Please hold my hand! Over here!

504
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:07,741
Oh, my God. This is insane.

505
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:11,620
Thanks to you, Jeong-heon,
our sales have gone up.

506
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,456
Those mom fans are so generous.

507
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:16,333
They even give you deer antler extract?

508
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,085
They are devoted fans.

509
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:20,045
You should have one.

510
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:22,005
Would that be okay? It looks so fancy.

511
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:23,215
Oh, of course.

512
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:24,675
My, look who it is.

513
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:25,592
Hello, Mr. Jang.

514
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:27,636
I'm surprised to see you here.

515
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:31,390
Oh, Mr. Jang.
Are you here to get your hair... Whoa.

516
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,432
What?

517
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,268
What brings you here?

518
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:36,144
I'm here to cast you.

519
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:39,064
Jeong-heon, I'd love to have you
on my new show.

520
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:42,067
I told you to talk to Ms. Ma
about these things.

521
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:45,487
I'm not an idiot. You always have her
turn people down for you.

522
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,198
Who's your head writer?

523
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:49,449
Oh, our head writer?

524
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:50,826
She's really good.

525
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:53,537
- It's Kim--
- No. Do you know Ms. On Woo-ju?

526
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:54,955
She's great at her job.

527
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:57,958
Of course I know her.
I hear she really messed up her last show,

528
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,501
and now she's planning a new one.

529
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,503
She's planning a new show?

530
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:03,422
Yeah, but it's literally just planning.

531
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,507
Who knows if it will get off the ground?

532
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:08,468
I doubt that it will,
seeing how incompetent she is.

533
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:11,179
Our head writer, though,
always gets amazing ratings--

534
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,264
Mr. Jang.

535
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:15,893
- Are you close with Ms. On?
- No.

536
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:17,936
So you're just rude then.

537
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:19,938
You talk about people behind their backs.

538
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:21,732
I don't want to work with someone rude.

539
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,318
- Hyeong-taek, Mr. Jang is leaving.
- Yes?

540
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:27,112
- Mr. Jang, let me walk you out.
- Wait, but...

541
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:29,072
Have some deer antler extract.
I'll call you.

542
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:31,366
- Oh, thanks.
- I hope you enjoy it. Bye!

543
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,660
- Hyeong-taek.
- Yes?

544
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,037
You know a lot of scriptwriters?

545
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:37,456
Yes.

546
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,416
This is actually better.

547
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,293
We're in a corner room,
so we can focus.

548
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,089
And the talent managers don't come here,
so we'll be left alone to focus.

549
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,008
Those are all talent managers.

550
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:50,260
I-na.

551
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:54,306
I love how it's next to the smoking area
and there are no bugs.

552
00:31:54,306 --> 00:31:56,266
We're so close to the bathroom too.

553
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,435
I'll make sure we move somewhere far away

554
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:00,312
from cigarette smoke and bathrooms.

555
00:32:00,312 --> 00:32:02,397
- Let's make our next show a hit, okay?
- Yeah.

556
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:05,275
I suddenly had an idea yesterday.

557
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:06,193
All right, check this out.

558
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,028
Lots of celebrities live on Jeju Island.

559
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:11,239
We could get some to Seoul
and compare their lives in the two places.

560
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,950
Like coming back to the city.

561
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,159
What do you think?

562
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,161
<i>Seoul Check-In.</i>

563
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:17,120
What?

564
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,082
I think Director Kim Tae-ho
already did that with Lee Hyo-ri.

565
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:23,293
Hey, mine would feature more people.

566
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:25,003
He only had Lee Hyo-ri.

567
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:28,423
Oh, it looked like Kim Jeong-heon
was looking for a new show to host.

568
00:32:28,423 --> 00:32:30,175
He wants to try something new.

569
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:31,927
Oh, Kim Jeong-heon?

570
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:34,346
If we could cast him,
the show would be a hit for sure.

571
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:35,889
Right?

572
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,058
He's not even that funny.

573
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,852
No, he's really hot right now.

574
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:44,272
I actually know his manager.
Should I ask about his schedule?

575
00:32:48,652 --> 00:32:49,945
I have an awards ceremony today.

576
00:32:49,945 --> 00:32:52,114
Oh. Did you win an award?

577
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:55,033
I'm going so I win one in the future.
All the celebs will be there.

578
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,536
I'll go hook them all in. Sparta!

579
00:32:57,536 --> 00:33:00,497
Ooh, ooh!
I-na, you said you'd say it together.

580
00:33:00,497 --> 00:33:02,082
Ooh, ooh.

581
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:06,378
No freaking way.

582
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:07,879
Oh, my gosh.

583
00:33:09,464 --> 00:33:11,133
Hello? Hi, Mr. Kang.

584
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:14,261
You know, we were just talking
about Mr. Kim Jeong-heon.

585
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:18,265
{\an8}Here she comes. You look fabulous!

586
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:21,518
All right. Thank you. Thank you, GVAN.

587
00:33:21,518 --> 00:33:24,604
Now, please welcome Kim Jeong-heon.

588
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:27,232
It's like the David statue
has come to life.

589
00:33:27,232 --> 00:33:29,026
Doesn't he look dashing?

590
00:33:29,026 --> 00:33:30,110
Look over here, please.

591
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,237
Please look to your left too.

592
00:33:32,237 --> 00:33:33,405
- That's cute.
- Over here!

593
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:35,949
- Okay. Thank you, Jeong-heon.
- Thank you.

594
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,576
All right.

595
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:41,038
This is a gift from Chairman Park Pil-gu
of Joa Tasty Rice.

596
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:42,706
Jeong-heon, I'm a big fan.

597
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:43,915
Oh, thank you.

598
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:45,959
Thank you for the gift.

599
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,419
Come on.

600
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:48,628
A rice cooker?

601
00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:51,423
Hang on.

602
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:53,383
Please take some pictures!

603
00:33:53,383 --> 00:33:56,553
- I love Joa Tasty Rice!
- He looks stunning holding a rice cooker.

604
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:58,055
Over here, please!

605
00:33:58,055 --> 00:33:58,972
Yes!

606
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:00,891
- Please look over here.
- I love it!

607
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:03,727
Isn't he the best? All right.

608
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:05,896
And look, he's very strong too.

609
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:09,232
Of course. Thank you, Jeong-heon.

610
00:34:09,232 --> 00:34:10,400
Thank you.

611
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,486
You're not here to shoot an ad.
How embarrassing.

612
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:15,280
Isn't embarrassment
better than losing a commercial?

613
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,115
I lost my old rice cooker commercial,

614
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:19,910
so I just got myself a new one.
Joa Tasty Rice!

615
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:24,831
Hey, Hyeong-taek. Did you find out?

616
00:34:25,624 --> 00:34:26,792
A different show?

617
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,336
Okay.

618
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:32,964
No, it's nothing.
I'll call you later. Bye.

619
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:35,425
Was that Mr. Kang? What is it?

620
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:37,219
Well, kind of.

621
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,471
"Kind of"?
You're acting suspiciously again.

622
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:40,514
Can I go in now?

623
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:42,766
- Yes, go ahead.
- Thank you.

624
00:34:44,434 --> 00:34:46,770
No, I haven't met Hey Meeny Miny Poe yet.

625
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,939
<i>You still haven't met her yet?</i>

626
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:50,565
- No.
- <i>All right.</i>

627
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:51,983
That's Lee Jeong-un.

628
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:54,736
Hello.

629
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:56,321
Sol, I just saw Lee Jeong-un.

630
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,447
You don't know him?

631
00:34:57,447 --> 00:35:00,200
Anyway, I'll go inside
and look for her, okay?

632
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,952
I'll call you later, honey. Bye.

633
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:05,789
Hey. This event is hosted by our company,

634
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:07,749
and the higher-ups are paying attention.

635
00:35:07,749 --> 00:35:11,294
If you do a good job here, I'm sure
Mr. Kim will give you another chance.

636
00:35:11,294 --> 00:35:12,629
Try not to be nervous.

637
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:15,382
God, I'm so nervous. Aren't you nervous?

638
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:17,300
Not at all.

639
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,261
Wow, impressive.

640
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,017
On Woo-ju.

641
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:36,820
It's been a long time.

642
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:39,906
You're right.

643
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:42,117
You look good.

644
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,290
- Are you--
- Ms. On Woo-ju?

645
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,208
Oh.

646
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:51,585
This is Director Ma Mi-ra.

647
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,171
I'm Ma Mi-ra.

648
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:56,882
Are you close with Jeong-heon?

649
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:00,969
No.

650
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:05,849
Please excuse me.

651
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:11,313
Mr. Song Ki-baek.

652
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:13,523
What are you doing here?

653
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:18,778
Oh, I am hosting the ceremony.

654
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:20,280
Oh.

655
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:22,782
Song Ki-baek?

656
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:27,037
I heard you became an anchor.

657
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:28,872
Good to see you. How have you been?

658
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:30,582
Hey.

659
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,835
Ji-hu, I've got to go change.
I'll catch you later.

660
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:34,920
All right.

661
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:37,547
Wait, Woo-ju.

662
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,674
Jeong-heon. I'm a fan.

663
00:36:39,674 --> 00:36:40,967
Can we take a picture?

664
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:44,930
- Thank you.
- Sure.

665
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,014
Awesome.

666
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:51,269
THE 1ST KOREA BRAND AWARDS

667
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:17,128
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

668
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:21,007
I thank you for your creation
and cultivation of world-leading brands

669
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:24,135
that represent Korea
in various fields of business.

670
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,057
It's such an honor to host
the first Korea Brand Awards.

671
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:31,851
I am Anchor Song Ki-baek of JBC.

672
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,526
HOTTEST ICON OF THE YEAR

673
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:42,487
And now, we move on to the award
for the Hottest Icon of the Year.

674
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:46,533
Here to present is Chairman Park Seong-jae
of Toto Olleh Chicken.

675
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,118
Please welcome him with a big hand.

676
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:50,036
TOTO OLLEH
1 MILLION WON GIFT CERTIFICATE

677
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:53,832
Now, let's find out
who the nominees are.

678
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:58,753
ONLINE SECTOR
HOTTEST ICON OF THE YEAR

679
00:37:59,337 --> 00:38:02,757
Ki-baek, your face looks a bit oily,
so let's put some powder on it.

680
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:07,304
<i>You guys are doing this because
I'm nice to you and do what you ask me to.</i>

681
00:38:07,304 --> 00:38:09,639
<i>Today, I'm a bit</i>...

682
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,077
These are the nominees
for the Hottest Icon of the Year.

683
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:34,080
With the rise of K-content
to new heights this year,

684
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,208
the competition is expected
to be extremely fierce.

685
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,918
Who will win this award?
It's pretty obvious.

686
00:38:39,502 --> 00:38:40,337
What?

687
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:49,846
Who will win this fierce competition
and claim this honorable award?

688
00:38:49,846 --> 00:38:52,015
Only one of the nominees
is here tonight.

689
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:02,192
For a small awards show like this,
only the winners show up.

690
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:12,285
The winner is Park Se-mi. Congratulations.

691
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:28,468
Park Se-mi is a comedian
who's widely known as Seo-jun's mom,

692
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:31,554
who is a character she plays
on her beloved YouTube channel.

693
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:34,265
Congratulations on your award again.

694
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:42,774
I'm sure you didn't give me this award
just because I'm the only one present.

695
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:46,945
Ki-baek, what are you doing?

696
00:39:46,945 --> 00:39:48,696
You're ad-libbing too much.

697
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:50,407
Ad-libbing? Are you kidding?

698
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:51,908
What did you just say?

699
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:53,034
No, no.

700
00:39:55,537 --> 00:39:57,247
Mr. Song, are you all right?

701
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,583
I don't think I can do this anymore.

702
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,626
What?

703
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:03,545
Mr. Song. Please go back up onstage.

704
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:05,672
I'm in no condition
to host the show right now.

705
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,715
Stop talking nonsense and get up there.

706
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:09,342
- No, but--
- Just go.

707
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:10,760
- Get up there.
- No, I really--

708
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,220
Ki-baek is going back onstage.

709
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,179
Stand by.

710
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:18,810
This is insulting.

711
00:40:21,938 --> 00:40:23,523
- Seriously.
- Oh, my word.

712
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:26,776
All right. Let's move on
to the next award.

713
00:40:26,776 --> 00:40:30,363
The next category is
Best Sports-Entertainer of the Year.

714
00:40:30,363 --> 00:40:32,282
Boy, this is the 19th award already.

715
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:34,659
I'll be presenting the award myself.

716
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:36,744
This is not a major award, so...

717
00:40:38,538 --> 00:40:40,123
Kim Seung-hyeon, congratulations.

718
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,626
BEST SPORTS-ENTERTAINER
OF THE YEAR

719
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:45,587
Let's give him a big round of applause.

720
00:41:00,852 --> 00:41:02,770
I have a lot of people to thank.

721
00:41:04,314 --> 00:41:06,816
- Heo Su-min of Ungok Entertainment.
- Tell him to keep it short.

722
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,859
Lee Jae-yong--

723
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:13,239
Oh, the staff just asked to make
the speech short and straightforward,

724
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:16,075
but you're the ones
who decided to present 19 awards.

725
00:41:17,994 --> 00:41:19,287
Feel free to finish.

726
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,084
Director Kim Hong-jun,

727
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:29,839
Manager Choi Ja-yeong,
Director Kim Geun-u, Director Lee Eun-ha,

728
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,052
Manager Kim Seon-jun, CEO Jang Ji-yeon
of Hair Boutique Gangnam--

729
00:41:34,052 --> 00:41:36,095
That's going to take forever.

730
00:41:36,095 --> 00:41:38,598
Why does everyone thank
such a long list of people?

731
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:40,892
If you want to thank someone,
do it whenever you can.

732
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:51,653
I'll keep working hard. Thank you.

733
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:55,907
Congratulations!

734
00:41:56,866 --> 00:41:57,992
Congratulations!

735
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:00,745
Unbelievable.

736
00:42:04,707 --> 00:42:06,459
Carry on.

737
00:42:09,546 --> 00:42:12,006
There's still an award left.
Best Actor of the Year.

738
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,639
Presenting the award is
Chairman Park Pil-gu of Joa Tasty Rice.

739
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,349
Let's welcome him with a big hand.

740
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,810
BEST ACTOR OF THE YEAR

741
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,271
Greetings. Well, may I announce...

742
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:30,316
Right, okay.
I'll announce the winner then.

743
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:33,403
The first Korea Brand Awards.

744
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:37,865
Best Actor of the Year goes
to Lee Jeong-un. Congratulations.

745
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:41,828
Let's give it up for him. Congratulations.

746
00:42:45,707 --> 00:42:50,420
Lee Jeong-un came back from
a long hiatus to play Kim Man-ho,

747
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,591
the drug king who dominates the world
of darkness, in last year's film <i>Junkers.</i>

748
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:58,845
Ironically, the reason he went on hiatus
was because of his alleged drug use.

749
00:43:02,557 --> 00:43:05,018
Drugs became his downfall
and his redemption.

750
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:07,228
He's the true drug king of our time.

751
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:09,689
I'm sorry!

752
00:43:49,312 --> 00:43:50,313
Ki-baek.

753
00:43:50,855 --> 00:43:52,106
Song Ki-baek!

754
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:53,650
Hey!

755
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:57,612
- What?
- Hey, are you okay?

756
00:43:57,612 --> 00:44:00,531
Oh, Mr. Kim.

757
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:04,077
Things could've gone
a lot worse, you know.

758
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,539
Mr. Kim. I'm sorry.

759
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:10,166
Come on, it's okay.

760
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:13,878
You just messed up
a stupid awards show. It's not a big deal.

761
00:44:15,463 --> 00:44:18,966
Don't let something like this
get you down.

762
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:21,386
Go back to how you were earlier.

763
00:44:22,095 --> 00:44:23,137
Sir?

764
00:44:23,137 --> 00:44:26,808
You had a lot of nerve
running your mouth like that.

765
00:44:27,392 --> 00:44:28,309
I...

766
00:44:28,935 --> 00:44:31,646
- Go ahead and say whatever you want.
- No, I...

767
00:44:31,646 --> 00:44:34,899
I can always find another news anchor.

768
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:38,528
What's the point of good qualifications,
a good family, and a nice image?

769
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:40,405
It's all meaningless.

770
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:43,324
They're all fake.

771
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,502
Mom.

772
00:44:54,502 --> 00:44:55,545
What are you doing here?

773
00:44:55,545 --> 00:44:58,005
What does it look like?
I'm working, of course.

774
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:01,551
I've got to earn every penny I can.
Am I right?

775
00:45:06,305 --> 00:45:08,599
Sweetheart, I know you've had a long day.

776
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:11,018
Mom.

777
00:45:12,645 --> 00:45:14,021
My perfect son.

778
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:15,773
You did nothing wrong, okay?

779
00:45:15,773 --> 00:45:18,359
It's not like you hit or killed someone.

780
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:20,486
You said a few things
that were on your mind.

781
00:45:20,486 --> 00:45:22,280
What's wrong with that?

782
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,160
Just lie to people again, honey.

783
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,995
You're good at that.

784
00:45:28,995 --> 00:45:32,039
You have to keep pretending
like we don't exist

785
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:35,835
and continue living a facade
as the perfect Song Ki-baek

786
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:39,797
so we can sponge off you forever. Right?

787
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:42,508
Mom.

788
00:45:59,942 --> 00:46:01,569
<i>I thought his family was well-off.</i>

789
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:04,864
<i>I heard you'd make the finance section
if your house were to be revealed.</i>

790
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:07,158
<i>They say he comes
from a powerful family.</i>

791
00:46:07,158 --> 00:46:09,452
<i>So he's not the prince but the pauper.</i>

792
00:46:09,452 --> 00:46:12,288
Says who?
You're the ones who created my image.

793
00:46:12,288 --> 00:46:14,457
It takes skills to build a good image!

794
00:46:14,457 --> 00:46:17,710
He's been acting like he's got it all
and like he's a good person.

795
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,422
Man, it's unbelievable.
It's all been complete lies.

796
00:46:23,841 --> 00:46:25,510
<i>I have to ask him for money today.</i>

797
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,012
<i>Can I ask for just another 100,000 won?</i>

798
00:46:28,012 --> 00:46:30,348
<i>Let's sit down and talk.</i>

799
00:46:55,623 --> 00:47:00,169
Huh? What... What's that?

800
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:26,988
What?

801
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,091
Huh?

802
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:54,265
What happened?

803
00:47:55,558 --> 00:47:56,392
44 UNREAD MESSAGES

804
00:47:58,144 --> 00:47:59,103
POSITION: NEWS DIVISION
NAME: SONG KI-BAEK

805
00:47:59,103 --> 00:48:00,855
Song Ki-baek is being penalized.

806
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:03,149
You know, I'm worried.

807
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:05,359
About what?

808
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,902
About Song Ki-baek.

809
00:48:06,902 --> 00:48:10,031
What if something really
happened to him in that accident?

810
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:11,073
What accident?

811
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:14,660
On Woo-ju.

812
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:18,331
Oh, Ms. Chae. It's been a while.

813
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:19,290
Hi.

814
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,584
What's going on?

815
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:24,086
Well, I was just in the neighborhood,

816
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:27,840
and I thought I'd stop by
your mom's hair salon.

817
00:48:29,634 --> 00:48:31,052
Go play with your grandma, okay?

818
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:33,262
Go ahead, Yeon.

819
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:36,474
- Bye.
- Bye.

820
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:42,438
Want to grab a coffee?

821
00:48:42,438 --> 00:48:44,732
I sent Yeon away
because I thought you'd do this.

822
00:48:45,775 --> 00:48:46,776
Let's go.

823
00:48:46,776 --> 00:48:48,778
Just leave. I have somewhere to be.

824
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:51,739
I sent her away
because I didn't want to embarrass you.

825
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:54,492
Goodbye.

826
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:13,386
What?

827
00:49:15,054 --> 00:49:16,597
What's going on?

828
00:49:19,558 --> 00:49:20,601
Oh...

829
00:49:29,402 --> 00:49:32,446
Don't you get clingy too, Beep Beep.

830
00:49:33,447 --> 00:49:34,573
God, this is embarrassing.

831
00:49:34,573 --> 00:49:38,953
Embarrassing? I love this car.
Why is it embarrassing?

832
00:49:38,953 --> 00:49:40,621
It's a used car for one thing,

833
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:43,082
and I spent the money
I saved for your birthday gift.

834
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:45,376
That's what makes it more meaningful.

835
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:47,545
That means I own a small part of it.

836
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:51,757
Oh, this is great.

837
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:55,344
Now you don't have to stay all night
at bus terminals to make morning shoots,

838
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:57,430
and you have a place to be
when you're on standby.

839
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,724
And we can go somewhere far together.

840
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:00,766
That's right.

841
00:50:02,977 --> 00:50:06,105
Please keep him safe, Beep Beep. Okay?

842
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:07,314
You named it Beep Beep?

843
00:50:07,314 --> 00:50:08,482
Yeah, Beep Beep.

844
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:12,361
It's the assistant director.

845
00:50:12,361 --> 00:50:13,612
Hello, sir.

846
00:50:13,612 --> 00:50:16,490
Oh, I'm on my way now. Yes.

847
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:19,410
Sorry? Liquid painkiller?

848
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:21,787
I don't have a liquid painkiller.

849
00:50:22,747 --> 00:50:24,999
Oh, no. I'll get you one.

850
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:27,668
Yes. Don't worry. Bye.

851
00:50:28,252 --> 00:50:31,839
We're in the middle of nowhere.
How are we going to find a pharmacy?

852
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:32,923
Ta-da!

853
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,427
There's a pharmacy right here.
How do you...

854
00:50:36,427 --> 00:50:38,888
What, never been bitten
by mosquitoes at a shoot?

855
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:42,308
Oh, Jeong-heon. Stop!

856
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:43,434
What? Oh!

857
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:46,145
TASTY DUMPLINGS AND STEAMED BUNS

858
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:48,355
Hello. Could I have a box of steamed buns?

859
00:50:48,355 --> 00:50:49,857
- All right.
- Thank you.

860
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:51,400
Sure, please enjoy.

861
00:50:52,985 --> 00:50:54,111
Are you hungry?

862
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:58,199
The FDs accidentally sat on a bag of buns
they were going to use,

863
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:00,409
and Yeong-gyu saw it.
He's refusing to eat them.

864
00:51:00,409 --> 00:51:03,204
But how did you even catch that?

865
00:51:03,204 --> 00:51:05,956
Wow. It's insane how quickly you think.

866
00:51:05,956 --> 00:51:10,002
They call me the super rookie
for a reason.

867
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:11,545
Let's go.

868
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:14,381
Come on, let's go.

869
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:32,149
<i>It can be described as disinhibition.</i>

870
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:35,694
<i>The lesion in your brain has caused
emotional dysregulation</i>

871
00:51:35,694 --> 00:51:39,448
<i>and personality changes
similar to symptoms of dementia.</i>

872
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:41,242
<i>But there's no danger to your life.</i>

873
00:51:41,242 --> 00:51:44,703
Nonetheless, considering your job,

874
00:51:44,703 --> 00:51:49,375
being unable to control the things you say
could be a challenging issue for you.

875
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:01,595
Hey. How are you?

876
00:52:03,514 --> 00:52:04,932
Move out of the apartment?

877
00:52:04,932 --> 00:52:06,475
It's a little unexpected.

878
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,228
You're moving back next month?

879
00:52:09,812 --> 00:52:11,689
You said I could stay
as long as I wanted.

880
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:13,107
I mean...

881
00:52:14,024 --> 00:52:16,068
I don't have money
to get a place right now.

882
00:52:17,278 --> 00:52:19,864
It's your apartment.
You can do whatever you want with it.

883
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:24,535
Your car is fine too.
Listen, I have to go.

884
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:45,890
Min-gu, all the locations
on your list looked great.

885
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,601
<i>The Fishermen and the Country</i> shot there.
They said it was amazing.

886
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:51,520
<i>I should've come with you.
I'm really sorry, Woo-ju.</i>

887
00:52:52,104 --> 00:52:53,188
Don't worry about it.

888
00:52:53,188 --> 00:52:55,524
I can check out these locations by myself.

889
00:52:55,524 --> 00:52:57,026
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

890
00:52:57,026 --> 00:52:58,235
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Bye.

891
00:52:59,445 --> 00:53:01,071
Wow, this place looks fantastic.

892
00:53:07,828 --> 00:53:09,038
Hey, isn't this nice?

893
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:11,957
Aren't you glad you came?

894
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,209
It's nice.

895
00:53:15,044 --> 00:53:18,839
It took me a lot of effort to join
<i>The Fishermen and the Country,</i> you know.

896
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,550
I should practice my fishing technique.

897
00:53:22,217 --> 00:53:24,011
That rock is a good fishing spot.

898
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:25,804
Yeah?

899
00:53:26,847 --> 00:53:29,058
There are a lot of things I want to ask,

900
00:53:29,642 --> 00:53:31,060
but we're here to have fun today,

901
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,520
so let's do that.
Talk to me when you're ready.

902
00:53:34,104 --> 00:53:35,064
Yeah.

903
00:53:36,231 --> 00:53:38,150
I'll catch you some black sea bream.

904
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:41,946
{\an8}FISHING EXPERIENCE

905
00:54:07,972 --> 00:54:09,348
Oh, you're adorable.

906
00:54:09,348 --> 00:54:11,600
This is supposed to be a good spot,

907
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,560
so why can't I catch a single minnow?

908
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,688
Even the god of the sea
couldn't get you one.

909
00:54:15,688 --> 00:54:18,399
Minnows live in freshwater,
not in the ocean.

910
00:54:18,399 --> 00:54:22,319
Touché. Fishing is all about waiting.

911
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,738
Aren't you supposed to be
the symbol of patience?

912
00:54:24,738 --> 00:54:26,115
Don't be ridiculous.

913
00:54:26,115 --> 00:54:27,908
Symbol of patience, my ass.

914
00:54:29,743 --> 00:54:31,036
You've been acting strange!

915
00:54:31,036 --> 00:54:32,413
You've changed. You know that?

916
00:54:34,331 --> 00:54:36,917
I'm going to go get something to drink.

917
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:38,293
My butt's too sore to sit here.

918
00:54:41,797 --> 00:54:43,465
He's so touchy these days.

919
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:45,217
- Thank you.
- Bye.

920
00:55:00,024 --> 00:55:02,401
Seriously, I'm not getting any bites.

921
00:55:04,486 --> 00:55:05,654
Hi, honey.

922
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,076
What? But she was fine until this morning.

923
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,996
Damn it. Okay.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

924
00:55:20,085 --> 00:55:21,128
Good God.

925
00:55:23,005 --> 00:55:26,467
Damn it, I should've worn sneakers.

926
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:38,562
Thank you for your cooperation.

927
00:55:38,562 --> 00:55:39,980
I'll be in touch.

928
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,532
Huh? What?

929
00:55:52,326 --> 00:55:53,827
Isn't that Song Ki-baek?

930
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:56,955
What's he doing over there alone?

931
00:56:21,313 --> 00:56:23,315
Everything isn't over yet, right?

932
00:56:25,484 --> 00:56:26,985
Maybe it's already over.

933
00:56:30,072 --> 00:56:32,366
What is the matter with you, Ki-baek?

934
00:56:34,243 --> 00:56:36,829
What did I do
to deserve something like this?

935
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:39,081
I've worked so hard to get here.

936
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,707
Huh?

937
00:56:51,468 --> 00:56:53,971
Man, it's so damn beautiful.

938
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,727
I'm really scared here.

939
00:57:03,188 --> 00:57:04,648
What's he doing up there?

940
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,120
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

941
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:21,123
Boy, now I'm even hearing things.

942
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:25,294
Hey, stop! Stop!

943
00:57:27,212 --> 00:57:28,964
Huh? Ms. On?

944
00:57:28,964 --> 00:57:31,258
Just calm down and get down here.

945
00:57:31,258 --> 00:57:33,010
I know it's hard, but don't do this!

946
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,220
Wait, what are you doing here?

947
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,181
Everything is going to be okay.

948
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:38,974
Come down here. Come on!

949
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,352
Did you follow me here? Why?

950
00:57:44,354 --> 00:57:45,647
Why are you coming up here?

951
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:49,401
I know you're stronger
than this, Mr. Song!

952
00:57:50,235 --> 00:57:52,154
Don't come up here! It's dangerous!

953
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:55,240
If you're feeling upset about something,
talk to me.

954
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,617
I'll listen, okay?

955
00:57:56,617 --> 00:57:58,327
Listen to what? I told you.

956
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:00,329
I'm not entirely fine!

957
00:58:01,413 --> 00:58:02,706
This is driving me crazy.

958
00:58:02,706 --> 00:58:04,374
Why are you doing this?

959
00:58:04,374 --> 00:58:05,542
Stop talking to me!

960
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:07,794
This wouldn't have happened
if I hadn't met you.

961
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:10,088
Why do you keep showing up in front of me?

962
00:58:10,088 --> 00:58:11,632
I said, don't come up here!

963
00:58:11,632 --> 00:58:13,342
Don't! Oh.

964
00:58:13,342 --> 00:58:15,427
Don't come near me. Just don't, okay?

965
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,765
Look, Mr. Song. Calm down. It's dangerous!

966
00:58:19,765 --> 00:58:22,559
- Get out of my sight!
- You'll fall!

967
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,521
Oh, for God's sake.
Why would you follow me here?

968
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:27,648
Oh, no! Don't move!

969
00:58:27,648 --> 00:58:29,608
Don't come near me!
Get out of my sight!

970
00:58:29,608 --> 00:58:30,776
You'll fall!

971
00:59:08,939 --> 00:59:10,691
FRANKLY SPEAKING 💞 @ kissasian.one

00:59:11,483 --> 00:59:13,610
{\an8}<i>Have you gone totally insane? Get a grip!</i>

973
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,903
{\an8}Help!

974
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:18,115
{\an8}When I see your face,
I get this strong feeling of...

975
00:59:18,115 --> 00:59:19,074
{\an8}I feel better now.

976
00:59:19,074 --> 00:59:21,201
{\an8}<i>Ms. On, I hear you're having a hard time.</i>

977
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:23,537
{\an8}Hey. Could you help me, please?

978
00:59:23,537 --> 00:59:27,040
{\an8}I'm genuinely interested
in your new show as a show host.

979
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,334
{\an8}<i>Just go. I'm not interested.</i>

980
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:32,045
{\an8}<i>I have a problem staying calm.</i>

981
00:59:32,045 --> 00:59:35,215
{\an8}<i>Who invited Song Ki-baek here?
This is just embarrassing.</i>

982
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:37,676
{\an8}<i>What if the switch turns on
when I'm at work?</i>

983
00:59:39,052 --> 00:59:41,013
{\an8}<i>You came to work? You've got thick skin.</i>

984
00:59:42,889 --> 00:59:45,058
{\an8}<i>The switch is turned on, isn't it?</i>

985
00:59:47,227 --> 00:59:51,231
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to <i>JBC News</i>.

986
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,453
Aren't you scared?

987
01:00:06,246 --> 01:00:09,499
My mom said there's a shark in there.

988
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,084
There's no shark.

989
01:00:11,084 --> 01:00:14,004
Your mom lied so you wouldn't spend
too much time in cold water.

990
01:00:14,004 --> 01:00:17,758
Also, when you grow up,
things like sharks don't scare you.

991
01:00:17,758 --> 01:00:20,677
What scares you is life.

992
01:00:26,683 --> 01:00:30,312
- Cold, isn't it?
- No, it's not cold at all.

993
01:00:30,937 --> 01:00:31,813
You're lying.

994
01:00:31,813 --> 01:00:34,107
I'm not lying.

995
01:00:35,484 --> 01:00:37,235
Aren't you cold?

996
01:00:37,235 --> 01:00:38,278
Nope.

997
01:00:39,196 --> 01:00:41,948
Are you the kind of grown-up
who never lies?

998
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,330
Somehow, that's what I've become.

999
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,461
Oh, it's really quiet.

1000
01:00:55,212 --> 01:00:56,171
That's cool.

1001
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,510
It's not cool. It's ruining me.

1002
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:04,137
People might say it's cool.

1003
01:01:05,097 --> 01:01:10,686
Or that it's satisfying without realizing
how it's completely messing up my life.

1004
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:13,397
Hey, can we be friends?

1005
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:18,485
I have a feeling something fun will happen
if I'm with you.

1006
01:01:19,444 --> 01:01:20,987
I'm not sure.

1007
01:01:25,909 --> 01:01:30,914
