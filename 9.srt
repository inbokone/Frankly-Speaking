FRANKLY SPEAKING 💞 @ kissasian.one

2
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:07,546
Is Song Ki-baek the person
in your heart right now?

3
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,394
{\an8}WHERE ARE YOU?

4
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:23,812
{\an8}I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU

5
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:26,190
Why isn't she responding?

6
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:28,192
Is she busy?

7
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:30,903
{\an8}I WANT TO SEE YOU

8
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:34,489
Yeah.

9
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:37,701
I like Ki-baek.

10
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,296
I'm sorry, and thank you.

11
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,301
But it's all in the past now.

12
00:01:58,555 --> 00:01:59,556
I'll get going.

13
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:16,907
Why am I so nervous?

14
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,369
Should I tell her tomorrow?

15
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,415
Let's tell her.

16
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,292
I should tell her.

17
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:48,313
Ki-baek!

18
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,086
The test results show nothing unusual.

19
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:12,587
Seems to just be fatigue.

20
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:16,341
We'll put him on a drip and let him rest.

21
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:17,676
He'll be all right.

22
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:27,853
Get his autograph.

23
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:30,522
Wow, this is cool.

24
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:33,108
What's he doing
at a small hospital like this?

25
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:03,555
The doctor said he'd be all right,
so don't worry.

26
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,517
He said he was sorry.

27
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:12,481
He apologized to me and my mom.

28
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:18,528
He said he came to see me to say that.

29
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,783
To put me at ease.

30
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,703
He was always like that.

31
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:30,415
He doesn't even show it when he's hurting.

32
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:34,044
He was about to faint,
but all he could think about was

33
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:36,338
his past mistakes and how sorry he felt.

34
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:41,134
He's such a weirdo.

35
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:19,840
You should've taken Woo-ju home.

36
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,261
Would you let yourself drive
if you were me?

37
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:26,888
I don't have indemnity insurance.

38
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:34,479
Turn on the radio or something.

39
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:38,191
You're a patient, not my boss.

40
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,445
Nice one, Mr. Song the driver.

41
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:48,076
<i>Let's find out how they first met.</i>

42
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:52,372
<i>Yes, Ms. Kang is in her forties.
She's divorced with two daughters.</i>

43
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:56,251
<i>Their situations were similar,
so they opened up to each other.</i>

44
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:59,129
<i>Yes. They could really
relate to each other.</i>

45
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,422
VOLUME

46
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:31,286
Hey, you're renting, aren't you?

47
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,747
Go if you're going to talk nonsense.

48
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,211
STILLS FROM COUPLE'S PARADISE

49
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:56,061
Oh, my PR team took those pictures.

50
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,438
Your pictures are there too.
Take them if you want.

51
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:06,696
Have you told her?

52
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:14,496
I was going to
but couldn't because of you.

53
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:15,789
I'm not sorry.

54
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:17,749
You crazy idiot.

55
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,376
Let me tell you this up front.

56
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:22,254
I'd never give
you and Woo-ju my blessings.

57
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:24,589
But if it'd make Woo-ju happy,

58
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:29,261
I could use my impressive capabilities
and wealth to help you out a little.

59
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:31,930
Jeez.

60
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,307
Woo-ju likes you a lot.

61
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,817
You see, I know the face she makes
in front of the man she likes.

62
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:48,363
So scram now, will you?

63
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:51,116
Don't make Woo-ju wait.

64
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:57,872
I'm off.

65
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,304
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

66
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:14,514
<i>- Where to?
- To you, On Woo-ju!</i>

67
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,099
<i>What?</i>

68
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:28,236
LET'S MAKE IT OFFICIAL

69
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,494
<i>I thought we were already official.</i>

70
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,792
{\an8}FALLING IN LOVE

71
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:50,383
<i>Man, I'm starving.</i>

72
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:53,178
<i>I got two fried chickens to celebrate
our 22nd day together.</i>

73
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:55,055
<i>Nice, you know the way to my heart.</i>

74
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:56,014
{\an8}I'LL BE THERE SOON

75
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,015
{\an8}BE SAFE

76
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:01,645
<i>If you're bored,
you can come to the subway station.</i>

77
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:04,022
<i>I'm not bored.
I came to pick up my girlfriend.</i>

78
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:06,274
<i>Come down. It's raining now.</i>

79
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:14,491
<i>I'm tired. I'm not in the mood
to talk to you today.</i>

80
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:16,326
<i>I added noodles and cheese.</i>

81
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:17,911
<i>I'm running on my knees.</i>

82
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:19,454
{\an8}<i>I'm still mad at you,</i>

83
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:22,290
{\an8}<i>but I can't let the glass noodles
get all soggy, so...</i>

84
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,669
{\an8}<i>You can punish me.
The tteokbokki did nothing wrong.</i>

85
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:37,389
Come on, quick! It's about to start.

86
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,934
- What's going on downstairs?
- They're watching TV.

87
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,561
- They won't come up here.
- Okay. It's on.

88
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,694
{\an8}HEAVEN HOUSE

89
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:52,737
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
COUPLE'S PARADISE

90
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:07,877
Oh, my God.

91
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,256
The real-time ratings
for the final episode

92
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:12,924
are over ten percent!

93
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:14,801
YEON

94
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:20,306
Yeon, it's important we keep our cool
when something like this happens.

95
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:25,270
We shouldn't act like
we've never tasted success before, but...

96
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:28,857
Hey, I haven't seen
two-digit ratings in so long.

97
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,776
My legs are all wobbly,
and my heart is pounding.

98
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:34,195
No, thump, thump.
It's beating like a drum.

99
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:37,699
Hurrah for On Woo-ju!
Seriously, hurrah for us.

100
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,077
I'm so happy. This is amazing.
We deserve a team dinner.

101
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:43,163
At one of those fancy restaurants,
you know?

102
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,748
All right, Yeon. Bye.

103
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:52,464
My goodness. Yeon is overly excited.

104
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:54,424
It's not professional to be like this.

105
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:57,177
I think you're more excited.
Are you that happy?

106
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:59,220
You don't know how amazing this is.

107
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,850
A five-episode pilot exceeding ten percent
is unbelievable. It's an epic success.

108
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,976
I see.

109
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,896
Right now,
the production team's group chat is...

110
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:10,190
It's hot. So hot!

111
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,441
- It's hot?
- Ouch.

112
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:12,358
What is this?

113
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:18,364
Look at this. Everyone's going wild.

114
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:19,282
THE SHOW'S OVER?

115
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:23,870
"Star writer, On Woo-ju"?

116
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:27,999
"Superstar, Song Ki-baek"?

117
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:42,472
We're floating.

118
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:45,892
Be careful!

119
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:50,730
It's so beautiful.

120
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:52,315
Look at the moon!

121
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:56,736
COUPLE'S PARADISE

122
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:58,112
Yes!

123
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,040
EPISODE 9: MAGIC CARPET RIDE

124
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,667
GO,
THE PILLAR OF THE SONG FAMILY!

125
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,710
RISING STAR SONG KI-BAEK!

126
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:17,048
- Congrats, son.
- Congrats.

127
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,759
- Everyone's talking about the show.
- Ouch, it's hot.

128
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,678
Your older brother hasn't eaten yet.

129
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:23,596
- It's fine. Dig in.
- All right.

130
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:25,473
It's hot. Can you help me?

131
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:28,393
My eldest son,
you'll go on to do bigger things,

132
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,561
so you have to eat well.

133
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:32,814
My phone's blowing up.

134
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:35,733
My friends are begging me
to let them come over

135
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:36,985
so they can see you.

136
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:40,363
Can I post a picture
of you on my Instagram?

137
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:41,698
Sure.

138
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:44,409
One chicken?
Couldn't you be more generous?

139
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,828
Do people buy two birthday cakes
if they're happy?

140
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:47,745
One's enough.

141
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:50,999
You like chicken porridge, honey.
The porridge is almost ready.

142
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,543
You can have this wing, Dad.

143
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:58,298
I'll just have the porridge.

144
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,472
Let's eat, all right?

145
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:07,599
Eat up.

146
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,976
I don't like wings because
of the slippery texture.

147
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:12,687
Ki-baek, you said you were going out.

148
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:13,813
Hurry up and eat.

149
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:16,274
Superstar Song, got plans today?

150
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:18,234
A commercial shoot.

151
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:19,152
What?

152
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:21,988
- A commercial?
- A commercial? Goodness.

153
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:23,364
Wow, that is amazing!

154
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:27,744
Now we can get one chicken per person...
No. Can we get beef?

155
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:30,288
Come on. I still have a long way to go.

156
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:32,832
Hurry up and eat.

157
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:41,132
Hello, Chief.

158
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:43,885
- This is for you guys.
- We got a regular slot!

159
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:48,139
- That sly chief director is all excited.
- Hey.

160
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:49,807
She said she'd reward us--

161
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:54,729
Oh, thank you in advance.

162
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:57,398
So does it mean the show can continue?

163
00:13:57,398 --> 00:14:00,902
Yes. The whole country is talking about
<i>Couple's Paradise</i> now.

164
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:02,779
The show must continue.

165
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,030
Thank you.

166
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,200
Ha-young, I trust you'll handle
the pressure well.

167
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,624
You haven't told your team yet?

168
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:15,833
Chief.

169
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,127
Everything's going great.
What's your problem?

170
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,254
It's not hard.

171
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:24,092
Restructure the team without Woo-ju,
and you'll get a regular slot.

172
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:26,135
Don't tell me you'll turn this down.

173
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:28,346
You have Ha-young. You guys can do it.

174
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,514
But this show...

175
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,557
Woo-ju wrote it.

176
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:33,184
I refuse to do it without her.

177
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,228
The series can't continue with Woo-ju.

178
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:37,480
Let's do what's best for the team.

179
00:14:38,314 --> 00:14:41,359
Seriously, must you all be such amateurs?

180
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:44,988
We should keep the momentum going.
Right, Ha-young?

181
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:49,283
You guys, get a grip.

182
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:51,452
Hello, everyone!

183
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,663
Oh, you're here.

184
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:54,580
I sure am.

185
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,500
Everyone's talking about the show,
so I ran here with a happy heart.

186
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,213
Chief, can we talk?

187
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:05,800
Director Chae, did you not have lunch?
Why are you so cranky today?

188
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,720
Chief, buy us some snacks. Something good.

189
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,930
Oh, sure thing.

190
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,974
Of course. That's no problem at all.

191
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:15,476
Here.

192
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:18,646
- Go pick up some snacks.
- Okay.

193
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:20,732
Buy lots.

194
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,072
<i>Hey!</i>

195
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,657
{\an8}<i>Level Nine, Level Nine</i>

196
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:31,576
<i>No problem</i>

197
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,244
{\an8}<i>Level Seven, Level Seven</i>

198
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:34,829
<i>I feel confident</i>

199
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:40,501
<i>Fly to the world of success with Genie Edu</i>

200
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,420
<i>Hey!</i>

201
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,466
<i>Fly, fly, let's fly, fly, fly</i>

202
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,801
Cut, all right!

203
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:50,219
Thanks, everyone.

204
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:53,347
We'll take a ten-minute break
before moving on to the next scene.

205
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,641
Prop team, the rug.

206
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:58,519
Don't forget to brush
the fringe on the rug.

207
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:00,646
Got it.

208
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:14,368
- Oh, thank you.
- Just talk to me casually.

209
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:16,245
I'll be with you wherever you go.

210
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,414
Sure.

211
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,214
MY WOO-JU:
GOOD LUCK

212
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:27,590
SOAR HIGH, SUPERSTAR SONG

213
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:36,974
{\an8}SOAR... LET'S SOAR HIGH!
I'LL SEE YOU LATER!

214
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:38,935
Ki-baek, can we take a picture--

215
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:39,936
One moment.

216
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,271
Would that be all right?

217
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:44,440
Yes, sure.

218
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:45,858
Thank you.

219
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:48,111
I became a fan
after watching <i>Couple's Paradise</i>.

220
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:49,320
Just one picture, please.

221
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,823
- Let me take it for you.
- Okay, thank you.

222
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:52,824
Here we go.

223
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:54,992
One, two.

224
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:58,037
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

225
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:01,916
- You can't post it on social media.
- Okay.

226
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,460
The shooting schedule isn't out yet, so...

227
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:09,590
It's natural to feel frazzled.

228
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:14,971
You're stoked that
you've risen to stardom,

229
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:17,181
but you're worried you'll suddenly fall.

230
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:20,309
Just enjoy it.

231
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,603
Show up when needed
and take the offered jobs.

232
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:25,982
I don't want to be overexposed.

233
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,568
You really are clueless.

234
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:32,196
For variety shows, the more familiar
people are with you, the better.

235
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:35,158
Show your face
as often as you can, when you can.

236
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:38,452
Not even God knows
when or how things could turn sour.

237
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:47,086
Yes.

238
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:49,505
What did I say?

239
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:51,632
I told you the show would be a hit.

240
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:55,178
If you hear anyone saying
I've lost my touch, bring them to me.

241
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:56,762
I'll teach them a lesson.

242
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:01,726
I'll have another talk with the chief.

243
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,311
You'll return as head writer,

244
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:06,397
and Ha-young will assist you
as the second writer. Right?

245
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:10,109
I certainly don't want to get off a horse
that's gaining momentum.

246
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:12,111
Besides, it's not like I have to steal

247
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:14,488
this show from Woo-ju
to survive as a writer.

248
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:17,325
What are you two doing?

249
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:21,996
I'm sorry to disappoint you guys,
but I've already left the team.

250
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:24,373
Yeon, don't be so lame.

251
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:29,003
Will you go to the variety show division
and beg them to save On Woo-ju?

252
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:32,215
Shouldn't you be focused
on securing a bigger budget

253
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:34,091
to make the show even better?

254
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:36,177
You're frustrating me here.

255
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:39,263
And you. You got the head writer position
to fill in for me.

256
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,599
One mistake and you're done for.

257
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,476
You'd better stay laser-focused.

258
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:46,562
Let's think about it.

259
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:49,857
Good God.
Stop thinking and have a meeting.

260
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,818
I'm off. Bye.

261
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:54,904
Oh, man.

262
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,710
No more bites, no more excuses.
You can do it.

263
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,128
Come to Weigh To Go Gym.

264
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:15,216
Lose fat and gain muscle.

265
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:17,260
Come to Weigh To Go Gym.

266
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,427
Please visit us.

267
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:20,763
That little...

268
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:43,411
Hello.

269
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:44,870
You remember me?

270
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:46,414
Nope.

271
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:47,999
Liar.

272
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,668
We know each other.
Why did you say hello to me, then?

273
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:53,504
My mom said
I should always say hello to my elders.

274
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:58,509
<i>My captain is a perfect mom too.</i>

275
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:00,928
Mister, why is my mom your captain?

276
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:03,055
What?

277
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:07,184
Oh, no. I was just...

278
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:24,869
Man.

279
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:27,121
We can do this together.

280
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:28,831
Here.

281
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,833
I can go home and get my mom's ladder.

282
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,627
Come on. Just let me lift you up.

283
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,464
Don't touch me!

284
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:37,548
Jeez. There.

285
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,389
<i>I should try to bond with him.</i>

286
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:47,933
Would you stop acting buddy-buddy with me?

287
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:49,852
Oh, sorry.

288
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:52,271
Have you eaten yet?

289
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:55,941
- Want some fried chicken?
- I hate fried chicken.

290
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:57,526
There's nothing I hate more.

291
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:02,573
Wait. Then what do you like?

292
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:04,575
Hey!

293
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:12,708
<i>They sent your pay for the commercial.</i>

294
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:28,349
STRIP LOIN
HANWOO

295
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,894
Song Ki-baek!

296
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:38,818
You know, Song Ki-baek had this
with Min Cho-hui on <i>Couple's Paradise</i>.

297
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:40,861
This was that product placement.

298
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:43,531
It's a new product.
It's buy one get one free.

299
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:45,950
Hello, sir. Try this.

300
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,493
Oh, sure. Thank you.

301
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:50,871
You'll also get
two fish cake bars for free.

302
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:53,290
Excuse me, aren't you...

303
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,792
No, I'm not a singer.

304
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:56,794
Aren't you Song Ki-baek?

305
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:03,843
I'm a huge fan!
Oh, it's him. It's Song Ki-baek!

306
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:05,886
- Song Ki-baek is here.
- Oh, my God.

307
00:22:05,886 --> 00:22:07,763
Can I please get your autograph?

308
00:22:07,763 --> 00:22:09,140
- Me too.
- Me too.

309
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:12,184
I don't have one yet.

310
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:17,314
I can't because
I don't have a signature yet.

311
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:19,150
How could he not have a signature?

312
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,110
If he doesn't want to, he can just say so.

313
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,611
No, that's not why.

314
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:26,615
It's my first autograph request,
that's why.

315
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,492
I see.

316
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:31,370
Would my credit card signature work?
Then I can do it.

317
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:33,789
Of course. Can I get it here?

318
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:35,958
Are these dumplings good?

319
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,334
I prefer them pan-fried.

320
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,503
I know this is tasty,

321
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,213
but it's overpriced.

322
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:43,299
Yikes, you should get a different one.

323
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:47,469
A fresh mackerel has clear eyes
and bright scarlet gills.

324
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:49,138
Get another one and I'll sign it.

325
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:50,639
Thank you. Yes.

326
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:52,349
Oh, sure.

327
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,187
- Thank you. You're handsome.
- Thank you.

328
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:18,334
Are you going away?
Why did you buy so many things?

329
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,253
I got paid, so I went shopping.

330
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:22,796
I bought this too.

331
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:24,256
Come sit.

332
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:27,092
No, what if someone sees us
sitting side by side?

333
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:29,803
Who cares? I bought this
so we could sit side by side.

334
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,473
Just for a minute, then.

335
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:39,980
Wow, this is nice.

336
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:43,943
For the first time in my life,
I shot a TV commercial,

337
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:46,111
got a manager, and signed autographs.

338
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:49,198
Fish cakes were two per person,
but I got seven.

339
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:50,199
Whoa.

340
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,826
I might get a car or even a house soon.

341
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:57,581
Man, I don't want to move.
I like being Woo-ju's upstairs neighbor.

342
00:23:58,332 --> 00:24:00,459
We can have a date at a nicer home.

343
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:02,461
A stay-home date?

344
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,463
Oh, cut it out.

345
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:11,011
So? Is your schedule full now?

346
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,806
I've booked one thing,
so it's a good start.

347
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:16,892
One thing? And you think
you can buy a car and a house?

348
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:22,064
What about you? How was your day?

349
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:23,816
How was the meeting?

350
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:26,026
Well...

351
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:28,487
It went well.

352
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,864
It went well?

353
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:31,991
That's it?

354
00:24:31,991 --> 00:24:32,908
That's it.

355
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:37,621
Wow, are all famous TV writers
cool like you?

356
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:43,794
Is it doable?

357
00:24:43,794 --> 00:24:45,504
Living with the switch on.

358
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:47,298
So far, yes.

359
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,177
Dr. Kim said it was important
to get used to the disinhibition symptoms.

360
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:57,308
Right, but I can't be glued to you 24-7,

361
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:59,560
so I should expose myself
to many situations.

362
00:25:00,227 --> 00:25:02,438
Okay, but let me know
when you really need me.

363
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:09,111
What?

364
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:12,239
You too. Let me know if you ever need me.

365
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:17,161
I feel like I'm always
the one reaching out to you.

366
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:20,873
Sure.

367
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,389
{\an8}I think that's fine. You must be tired.

368
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:40,142
{\an8}- Is it true our show is getting canceled?
- Apparently.

369
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:42,394
What do you expect?
The main host is a loser.

370
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:45,856
He went on <i>Couple's Paradise</i>
and made a complete fool of himself.

371
00:25:45,856 --> 00:25:47,608
It was nice before.

372
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:50,611
Who'd want him as a son-in-law now
after he got rejected?

373
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:52,071
Excuse me.

374
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:54,073
Please watch what you say on set.

375
00:25:54,073 --> 00:25:55,824
Hey, what did you just say?

376
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:58,410
You shouldn't bad-mouth
Jeong-heon like that.

377
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,997
Let's be honest. He was the reason
this program was started.

378
00:26:01,997 --> 00:26:03,707
Gosh, I'm so scared.

379
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,710
- It's not like what we said isn't true.
- Hey!

380
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,003
Hyeong-taek.

381
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,714
I'm going in.

382
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:14,510
Hello.

383
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,845
- Hello.
- Hello.

384
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:18,847
- You're early.
- Yes.

385
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:22,017
Stand by, everyone. We'll get started.

386
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:27,523
All right, we're rolling.

387
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,610
Ready, cue!

388
00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:34,655
Are you having relationship problems?

389
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:37,032
Bring all your romantic concerns to us!

390
00:26:37,032 --> 00:26:38,951
We'll be your counselor and adviser.

391
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:49,628
Hey, you're home.

392
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:50,546
Yes.

393
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,340
Oh. Ki-baek, you're home.

394
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:57,052
Honey, do your knees still hurt?

395
00:26:57,052 --> 00:26:58,762
Maybe it's going to rain.

396
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:00,514
Ki-baek, take your umbrella tomorrow.

397
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:03,183
When your dad's knee hurts,
it always rains the next day.

398
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:09,064
If it hurts, you should go see a doctor.

399
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:10,816
Oh, come on.

400
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:13,068
It's nice not having to check the weather.

401
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:16,447
- The pain subsides quickly anyway.
- And he has seen a doctor.

402
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:20,159
Things that were functioning fine
can suddenly break down at our age.

403
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,203
It costs money to see a doctor.
Plus, it's a hassle.

404
00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:26,665
He should've seen one right away.

405
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:28,375
Accidents can have
long-term complications.

406
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:31,670
Back then, we couldn't afford it.
You know that.

407
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:33,589
Did you have dinner?

408
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:35,340
Should I fix you something to eat?

409
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,259
I ate.

410
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:46,602
And turn on the lights in the evening.

411
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:00,491
It's Hanwoo.

412
00:28:19,092 --> 00:28:20,260
We're closed now.

413
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,013
Oh, really?

414
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:26,433
Well, I saw that the lights were still on.

415
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:29,144
I'm tidying up now. Sorry.

416
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:34,650
Want to have a late-night snack?
I'm kind of hungry.

417
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:37,611
Oh, you have a customer. I'm sorry.

418
00:28:39,905 --> 00:28:41,406
Mom, you have a customer.

419
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:42,991
We're closed.

420
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:43,909
What?

421
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:45,953
But...

422
00:28:47,996 --> 00:28:49,498
Ma'am, we're closed.

423
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,502
I'm sorry.

424
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,019
You wanted a snack?

425
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,313
Yes. How about fried chicken?

426
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:14,731
Sure.

427
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:16,191
- Half and half?
- Yup!

428
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:30,330
All right.

429
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,875
Oh, it's hot. The toast is ready.

430
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,128
I'll have it with some butter.

431
00:29:37,588 --> 00:29:40,007
Shoot. My strawberry jam.

432
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:45,637
<i>Everyone knows
Butter and strawberry jam go hand in hand</i>

433
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:48,307
Let's go.

434
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:56,773
My new strawberry jam.
I'll put some strawberry jam and...

435
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:03,655
Please make sure to keep that room
out of the frame.

436
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:04,573
Sure thing.

437
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,328
All right.

438
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:10,913
Nice.

439
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:12,873
Now I'll enjoy--

440
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,627
Who's that?

441
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:20,088
Oh, hey. What's up?

442
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,132
It is nice to see you, friend.

443
00:30:22,883 --> 00:30:23,842
What are you doing?

444
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:25,010
What do you mean?

445
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,929
I'm greeting my friend.

446
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:28,013
My God.

447
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,724
Jesus Christ.

448
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:38,273
The shot of him at the door is unusable.
He and I will just talk casually.

449
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:39,191
Sure.

450
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,442
Just be yourself.

451
00:30:41,777 --> 00:30:43,570
You could never be an actor.

452
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,241
Hey, here.

453
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:50,535
It's unlike you to buy stuff.

454
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:51,453
I know, right?

455
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:54,539
The writers asked me
to pick up snacks you'd like.

456
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,333
Do you even know what I like?

457
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:01,088
Hey, top student.
You have an amazing memory.

458
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:03,590
Are these gummy worms yours?

459
00:31:04,424 --> 00:31:06,927
You can't have these
because you ranked 200th in school.

460
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:08,095
What, 200th?

461
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:09,471
Edit this out, please.

462
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:12,307
Hey, why are you revealing my class rank?

463
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:13,976
You started it.

464
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:15,978
I called you top student to talk you up.

465
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:18,730
As if that would catapult me into stardom.

466
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,898
What's this gibberish?

467
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:21,608
You'd better not touch these.

468
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:23,694
I guess they're super close.

469
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,197
- Yes.
- Oh, this two-shot is interesting.

470
00:31:27,197 --> 00:31:28,240
Good stuff.

471
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,282
What a weirdo.

472
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,792
PROPOSAL

473
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:44,256
<i>Restructure the team without Woo-ju,
and you'll get a regular slot.</i>

474
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:46,508
<i>The series can't continue with Woo-ju.</i>

475
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:51,638
Let's get some work done.

476
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:54,349
I can write another show.

477
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:55,809
I can do this.

478
00:32:08,947 --> 00:32:10,407
DIRECTOR HAN YE-SEUL

479
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:15,620
Hi, Director Han. It's been a while.

480
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:17,664
Yes.

481
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,083
Later today? Of course, I'm available.

482
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,586
Okay. See you later, then.

483
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:23,545
All right.

484
00:32:42,814 --> 00:32:44,066
Hey, get up.

485
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,150
Why?

486
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,361
Will you just sit here and do nothing?

487
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:56,495
Hey, what's this?

488
00:32:57,412 --> 00:32:59,873
You said you were here to work,
so let's work.

489
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:03,376
I'm not sure if I can do it.
It's been a while

490
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:04,377
Nice, okay.

491
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:06,588
What is this? I have to dance?

492
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:07,589
Get ready.

493
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,427
You chose your song. This is unfair.

494
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,056
This isn't too bad. Right?

495
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,808
Oh, nice.

496
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:19,559
Do we really have to do this?

497
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,687
You have to do this
if you want to get paid, all right?

498
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:26,691
The dance goes perfectly with the song.
This is great.

499
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:29,402
Move aside
if you don't think you can do it.

500
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:30,862
It's too hard for you. Move.

501
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:34,407
You move aside. Let me try.
You think I can't do it?

502
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:35,742
<i>I'm your raccoon</i>

503
00:33:35,742 --> 00:33:39,621
<i>Even if you call me sly
No matter what you say</i>

504
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:40,622
You know my song.

505
00:33:40,622 --> 00:33:42,624
- Of course.
- Nice.

506
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:45,585
I mean, not of course.
But everyone in the country knows it.

507
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:48,004
<i>You're my adorable chubby chub chub</i>

508
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:50,882
<i>I'm your strong, muscular man</i>

509
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:52,884
<i>Wherever we go, we're stars</i>

510
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:55,762
<i>Shake away, let's have some fun</i>

511
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:05,313
All they've done is play that game.

512
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:06,398
What should we do?

513
00:34:09,192 --> 00:34:10,318
All right, cut!

514
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:12,696
Well, why don't we take a break?

515
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:14,906
Nice dance. Well done.

516
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:17,492
I feel like we could use
something else though.

517
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:20,245
You really can't show us that room?

518
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:21,329
Like, no way?

519
00:34:23,165 --> 00:34:26,459
Everyone thinks the viewers
would be very curious.

520
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:28,003
Can you let me take a peek?

521
00:34:28,587 --> 00:34:32,841
Director, we already talked about this.
Why are you being like this?

522
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:35,302
We're doing this purely for the show.

523
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:36,553
It's a reality show.

524
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:40,599
Do people in reality shows
have to shower naked?

525
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:45,061
They keep their underwear on.
Isn't it just basic privacy protection?

526
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:46,813
Well, this is different.

527
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:50,275
It's not like I'm forcing him
to do this shoot in the room.

528
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:52,277
I was just asking, that's all.

529
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:56,031
Everyone has something
they don't want to talk about

530
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:58,575
or see become the subject of gossip.

531
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,995
I was talking to Jeong-heon.
No need to put me on the spot.

532
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:03,079
Forget it.

533
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,956
That door will remain closed.

534
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:07,834
It's nothing to get worked up about.

535
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,045
And you, don't overreact.

536
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,798
Let's play one more round then.

537
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:17,427
Why don't we continue tomorrow?

538
00:35:17,427 --> 00:35:19,387
You won't get any more useful shots today.

539
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:20,931
Let's talk.

540
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,307
- But...
- Actually, just leave.

541
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:25,060
- Seriously?
- Come on.

542
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:36,488
All you need is sundae
with steamed pork liver.

543
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:38,615
Why did they tell me to get
so many things?

544
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:40,158
- You won't even eat these.
- Hey.

545
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:42,619
Stop distracting me.
Go sit down. I got this.

546
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:44,704
I was just trying to help.

547
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:45,997
Go away.

548
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:46,915
Seriously...

549
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:53,463
You're a lightweight.
Why do you have so much booze at home?

550
00:35:58,009 --> 00:35:59,219
{\an8}KAOLIANG LIQUOR

551
00:36:01,388 --> 00:36:03,139
Is this the bottle from that time?

552
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:07,269
Are you crazy? It's not like we dated.
Why would I still have that bottle?

553
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:08,770
The one in there costs way more.

554
00:36:14,526 --> 00:36:15,443
<i>What's that?</i>

555
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:17,445
I stole it from my dad.

556
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:19,197
Did he hit you again?

557
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,992
Don't ask. It freaking hurts.

558
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,828
He'll hit you again if he finds out.

559
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,663
I don't care.

560
00:36:26,663 --> 00:36:28,748
Can I stay with you for a few days?

561
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:29,874
- Nope.
- Why not?

562
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,751
Because I feel like he'd beat me up too.

563
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:33,878
Yeah, right. Bullshit.

564
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:36,423
Psycho. You're laughing?

565
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:39,759
Should I cry, then?
Will you let me stay with you if I cry?

566
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:43,054
Oh, should I act pitiful?

567
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:45,015
Pitiful, my ass.

568
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:47,142
You always do whatever the hell you want.

569
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:48,268
Hey.

570
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:52,605
Try living with my dad for a week
and see if you can say that.

571
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:55,150
Just wait until I make my debut.

572
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,070
I'll be sure to make him regret
treating me like garbage.

573
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:06,536
The judge who ruthlessly punishes
criminals in court comes home

574
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:09,205
and beats up his family ruthlessly.

575
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:12,125
He fractured my brother's ribs
when he was in twelfth grade.

576
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:16,963
It's embarrassing.

577
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:20,550
You know I only tell you
these things, right?

578
00:37:22,344 --> 00:37:24,429
My family is so messed up.

579
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,391
Yeah, so is my family.

580
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:42,405
I'm transferring.

581
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:44,949
What?

582
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:46,910
Ever live in a basement apartment?

583
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:49,371
Are you drunk after one sip?

584
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:53,249
The creditors might track us down,

585
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:57,962
so we have to keep moving to neighborhoods
where no one knows us.

586
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:00,757
And I have to transfer.

587
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:04,010
Have you ever been on the run?

588
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,805
What the heck are you saying? Weirdo.

589
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,767
I'm telling you my secret too.

590
00:38:24,406 --> 00:38:25,824
You can stay for a drink.

591
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:29,869
Why would I have a drink with you?
That's absurd.

592
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:32,872
I'm off.

593
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:52,642
<i>Let's do a show together.</i>

594
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:55,645
What kind? Tell me the main concept.
I'll get right on it.

595
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:58,273
No, no. The writer and I
have it all mapped out.

596
00:38:58,273 --> 00:38:59,441
We want you in the show.

597
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,067
What?

598
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:06,781
We're launching a YouTube channel,
and we want you as our first guest.

599
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:09,826
We'll also get a few other people
who were on <i>Couple's Paradise</i>.

600
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:10,952
What do you think?

601
00:39:13,037 --> 00:39:15,373
You need to reap the benefits
of the show's popularity.

602
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:17,041
You're the talk of the town.

603
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,918
I'm sorry, Director Han.

604
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:20,378
I don't think I can do it.

605
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:23,882
Did you agree to something else?
I'll work around your schedule.

606
00:39:25,383 --> 00:39:27,010
I won't appear on any shows.

607
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:29,888
This isn't why
I went on <i>Couple's Paradise</i>.

608
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:37,145
If you need another writer, let me know.

609
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:39,564
All right, I will.

610
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:47,614
Hi.

611
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:49,449
<i>Hey. Shall we have dinner together?</i>

612
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:50,992
<i>Let's go to that gopchang place.</i>

613
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:53,536
I'm kind of busy right now.

614
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:57,207
Sorry, Mom. I'll call you back later.

615
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,423
ANNOUNCER YOON JI-HU

616
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:18,061
{\an8}DEAR DAD, THANK YOU
FOR BRINGING ME INTO THIS WORLD

617
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,524
Hey, Ji-hu. I wish you all the best.

618
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:23,441
Oh, thank you.

619
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:26,194
Ji-hu, I'm surprised.
I really didn't know you'd quit.

620
00:40:26,194 --> 00:40:27,445
Oh, yeah?

621
00:40:27,445 --> 00:40:28,696
Keep in touch.

622
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:29,614
Will do.

623
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:38,456
All right.

624
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:45,922
SONG KI-BAEK

625
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:48,299
Hey, I'm at a meeting now.

626
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:49,968
I'll call you back in a bit.

627
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,429
- Hello.
- Hello.

628
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:55,014
- It's been a while.
- I know.

629
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:26,296
The salon is closed for the day.

630
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:27,463
Come back another time.

631
00:41:57,785 --> 00:41:58,870
Hey, you're home.

632
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,418
You're eating that by yourself?

633
00:42:07,253 --> 00:42:08,421
I've been busted.

634
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:10,465
Eat up. It's still warm.

635
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:12,842
Want a drink too?

636
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:22,185
You were so little and cute,
like a cherry tomato,

637
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:23,811
but you're all grown up now.

638
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:40,119
When we first met,

639
00:42:40,912 --> 00:42:42,622
you were about this tall.

640
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:03,935
<i>I've lived one hell of a life, you know.</i>

641
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:08,231
<i>I lost my parents at a young age,
and my first love failed.</i>

642
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:12,151
<i>Then I ended up with the shamanic illness.</i>

643
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:17,907
<i>It was as if my whole body was
disintegrating every day,</i>

644
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:22,245
<i>but I couldn't afford to see a doctor.
Not that they could do anything.</i>

645
00:43:25,123 --> 00:43:27,417
<i>The shaman I met that day said to me,</i>

646
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,878
<i>"You're not destined to be a shaman.</i>

647
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:34,090
<i>You're just fated to die young
because of your shamanic illness."</i>

648
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:36,968
GRAMOXINE
HERBICIDE

649
00:43:52,734 --> 00:43:53,985
I'm hungry.

650
00:43:55,653 --> 00:43:58,531
<i>I had eaten even though
I was determined to kill myself,</i>

651
00:43:58,531 --> 00:44:01,075
<i>but that kid clearly wanted to live,
so what could I do?</i>

652
00:44:01,784 --> 00:44:02,785
<i>I had to feed her.</i>

653
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,749
Thank you.

654
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,084
Just eat your food.

655
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:17,633
<i>I thought, "I'll just wait until
she finishes her food and go kill myself."</i>

656
00:44:21,888 --> 00:44:23,765
<i>But no one was looking for her,</i>

657
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,058
<i>and she had no one to look for.</i>

658
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:35,401
<i>"Okay, just one more meal.</i>

659
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,951
<i>Then I'll go and do
what I'd set out to do."</i>

660
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,918
<i>"Just one more meal."</i>

661
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:56,380
Thank you for the food!

662
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,133
<i>"Just one more meal."</i>

663
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:04,514
<i>"For one last time."</i>

664
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:21,405
There, it's done.

665
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:24,825
Wow!

666
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:29,413
One, two, three.

667
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:36,045
Here, this is for you.

668
00:45:36,045 --> 00:45:37,338
Thank you.

669
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:53,104
So that's why I'm still alive,

670
00:45:53,104 --> 00:45:54,814
thanks to my daughter, Woo-ju.

671
00:45:57,149 --> 00:46:00,236
Which is why I'm so grateful to the woman

672
00:46:00,236 --> 00:46:01,529
who birthed you

673
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,032
and sent you to me.

674
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:08,119
You said she had
a big birthmark on her hand.

675
00:46:19,422 --> 00:46:20,631
You finished all the booze.

676
00:46:21,257 --> 00:46:22,383
I'll go get more.

677
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,521
<i>We got a regular slot
for</i> Couple's Paradise,

678
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:37,231
and we'd love it if you could join.

679
00:46:38,274 --> 00:46:40,818
It's a good idea.
And it's a win-win for both of us.

680
00:46:42,528 --> 00:46:45,072
I guess Woo-ju will be very busy
for a while.

681
00:46:45,656 --> 00:46:48,576
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

682
00:46:48,576 --> 00:46:51,329
Woo-ju has completely left the team.

683
00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:54,832
That was the condition
for the regular slot.

684
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:57,335
<i>And Woo-ju decided to leave.</i>

685
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,895
{\an8}POOPY KI-BAEK:
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

686
00:47:18,731 --> 00:47:20,733
{\an8}I'M WORKING

687
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:25,029
You're working at a playground?

688
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,659
Man, look at you lying
to someone who can't lie.

689
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:30,576
How mean.

690
00:47:31,494 --> 00:47:33,537
Well, I was just...

691
00:47:35,164 --> 00:47:36,415
Did something happen?

692
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,292
No.

693
00:47:46,384 --> 00:47:48,761
Well, it's a beautiful night.

694
00:47:50,262 --> 00:47:51,263
How about a date?

695
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:53,516
Sure.

696
00:47:57,269 --> 00:47:59,105
- Want to check out this place?
- Sure.

697
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:00,398
It looks nice.

698
00:48:00,398 --> 00:48:02,900
Oh! That's Song Ki-baek.

699
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,568
Isn't she that writer?

700
00:48:04,568 --> 00:48:06,404
- Is it her?
- I think so.

701
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:08,155
- Let's go somewhere else.
- What?

702
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,115
Come on.

703
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:14,078
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

704
00:48:14,704 --> 00:48:16,872
- How dare she reject Jeong-heon?
- I know.

705
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:18,666
I hate On Woo-ju.

706
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,252
- Who does she think she is?
- She's insane.

707
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:22,545
She's so annoying.

708
00:48:22,545 --> 00:48:24,463
Three servings of tteokbokki, please.

709
00:48:24,463 --> 00:48:26,465
- And some fish cakes.
- Looks good.

710
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:28,592
- Right? Look at that color.
- It looks so good.

711
00:48:28,592 --> 00:48:30,970
- It looks amazing.
- I wanted something spicy.

712
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,971
Really? Why?

713
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:36,684
I see why paparazzi catch
celebrity couples

714
00:48:36,684 --> 00:48:39,061
at their homes or in parking lots.

715
00:48:40,438 --> 00:48:41,480
Let's just go home.

716
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,817
No, let's find a place
with no one else around.

717
00:48:47,945 --> 00:48:49,488
Okay, let's go.

718
00:48:51,949 --> 00:48:54,201
- Where are we going?
- Just come with me.

719
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,085
It's usually pretty quiet here at night.

720
00:49:03,085 --> 00:49:05,755
I used to come here to jog.

721
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:08,507
It really is quiet.

722
00:49:10,843 --> 00:49:12,887
Oh, right. Did the shoot go well?

723
00:49:12,887 --> 00:49:14,054
The one with Jeong-heon.

724
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:15,181
Not really.

725
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:17,933
- We almost got into a fight.
- Why?

726
00:49:18,476 --> 00:49:20,644
Maybe not really a fight.

727
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:25,232
Anyway, it's a long story.
I'll tell you another time.

728
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:28,360
But you guys did the shoot, right?

729
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,362
Yeah, I think they got enough shots of me.

730
00:49:30,905 --> 00:49:32,948
And I'm sure
Jeong-heon knows what he's doing.

731
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:34,200
He's good at this stuff.

732
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:37,787
How about you, Woo-ju?

733
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,413
How was it?

734
00:49:39,955 --> 00:49:41,874
- How was what?
- Just everything.

735
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,375
Are you okay?

736
00:49:44,794 --> 00:49:47,588
Well, yeah. I'm pretty okay.

737
00:49:50,174 --> 00:49:51,383
Hey...

738
00:49:54,053 --> 00:49:58,015
If you're not okay, just say so.

739
00:50:01,352 --> 00:50:06,190
When you're hurting or stressed,
it's okay to say so.

740
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:09,985
All right.

741
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:14,365
You don't have to bawl your eyes out,
but you can vent.

742
00:50:14,365 --> 00:50:17,409
If I cry and vent,
will that change anything?

743
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:20,663
Hey.

744
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:22,456
I'm okay. What's with you?

745
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:27,962
Why do you always say you're okay?

746
00:50:30,923 --> 00:50:33,133
You can just tell me, you know.

747
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:41,517
I know how you feel.

748
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:44,937
I'm grateful to have you,
to know someone's got my back.

749
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:47,898
So...

750
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,694
I really am okay.

751
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,191
Not now. I mean...

752
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,664
Well, you see...

753
00:51:45,664 --> 00:51:46,749
Mr. Song is just--

754
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:48,751
I know. You guys live together, right?

755
00:51:49,293 --> 00:51:51,670
I found out while gathering info
on the cast.

756
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,213
You two weren't family,

757
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:56,300
and you said you'd rented out
the second floor of your house,

758
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,676
so I figured that was it.

759
00:51:57,676 --> 00:51:59,428
Yes, you're spot on.

760
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,848
But seeing how flustered he is,
maybe you two are

761
00:52:02,848 --> 00:52:05,100
more than just landlord and tenant.

762
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,271
Well, he's quirky, you know.
He's like that every time I run into him.

763
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:10,522
Hello, Mr. Song!

764
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:12,191
Oh, yes. Hello.

765
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:15,444
It's been a while, I-na.

766
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:17,279
Oh, hello.

767
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,782
You must be very busy these days.
Congrats.

768
00:52:19,782 --> 00:52:21,283
Thank you.

769
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:24,578
I don't really have
anything to do right now,

770
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:27,748
but I should go inside.

771
00:52:28,999 --> 00:52:31,460
Hold on. I-na, what brings you here--

772
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,964
- Mr. Song, aren't you busy?
- I have nothing going on today.

773
00:52:34,964 --> 00:52:36,090
What?

774
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,800
No.

775
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,552
There's something
we've been doing together for a while.

776
00:52:45,224 --> 00:52:46,475
Want to join us?

777
00:52:53,232 --> 00:52:57,403
I'm sorry. I don't think we can produce
the special episode of <i>Couple's Paradise</i>.

778
00:52:59,363 --> 00:53:00,406
Why not?

779
00:53:00,406 --> 00:53:03,409
I can't persuade them to join.
They're all so famous now.

780
00:53:05,035 --> 00:53:10,582
I mean, we might still be able to,
if you could help me persuade them.

781
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:17,131
By the way, you and Ki-baek are
on good terms, aren't you?

782
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:18,257
Pardon me?

783
00:53:18,257 --> 00:53:21,218
You talk about him a lot
during your live broadcasts.

784
00:53:21,802 --> 00:53:22,636
Right.

785
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,014
Yes, we are.

786
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:28,726
I'm just going to be honest.

787
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:31,895
I talked to him on the phone.

788
00:53:32,438 --> 00:53:35,065
He said he'd never do anything with you.

789
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,484
I see.

790
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:46,910
Where should I put this? Okay.

791
00:53:47,411 --> 00:53:48,370
Goodness.

792
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,300
Did you have to tag along?

793
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,344
Well, I had nothing to do,
and this is a good deed.

794
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:07,306
It might seem suspicious if you're
seen together, but not with me.

795
00:54:07,306 --> 00:54:09,058
And there won't be a lot of people.

796
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:12,311
There's nothing to suspect.

797
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:13,479
Go on. I'll follow you.

798
00:54:13,479 --> 00:54:15,022
Take your time.

799
00:54:15,022 --> 00:54:16,023
All right.

800
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:18,901
- Hello!
- Oh, hello.

801
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:21,195
- You should've said no.
- Hi, I-na.

802
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:23,739
But how? I didn't want to say no.

803
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:26,742
I should've just punched you right away.

804
00:54:26,742 --> 00:54:28,327
You're quite violent.

805
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:30,037
Since you're here,

806
00:54:30,037 --> 00:54:32,748
stay focused on why you're here
and just do laundry.

807
00:54:32,748 --> 00:54:34,875
Just do laundry. Okay, here.

808
00:54:38,462 --> 00:54:39,379
Should I take this?

809
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:41,965
Call me if you want to sneeze.

810
00:54:42,758 --> 00:54:43,592
Will do.

811
00:54:44,802 --> 00:54:47,846
Man, seriously. For God's sake.

812
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:49,598
LAUNDRY LOUNGE

813
00:54:58,816 --> 00:55:00,109
Can you wash this too?

814
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:01,026
Sure thing!

815
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:02,111
Thank you.

816
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:05,447
Guess she hasn't washed this in a while.

817
00:55:05,447 --> 00:55:08,033
Look, the water is turning murky. Nice.

818
00:55:18,377 --> 00:55:20,629
Stop staring at me and wash that thing.

819
00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:22,506
We're here to work.

820
00:55:23,715 --> 00:55:24,550
Okay.

821
00:55:35,936 --> 00:55:37,855
We're done!

822
00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:45,404
Why are you grinning?

823
00:55:46,363 --> 00:55:47,364
Because you're pretty.

824
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:50,534
Well, it's not like
I'm not pretty on other days.

825
00:55:50,534 --> 00:55:53,287
Are you going to say that
every time you see me?

826
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:55,414
I like you more
because you're pretty every day.

827
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:58,959
I brought food.

828
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,169
Oh, that's...

829
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:03,505
The ladies over there said
we should all eat together.

830
00:56:03,505 --> 00:56:05,132
I told them you'd eat separately.

831
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:06,508
Oh, okay.

832
00:56:07,426 --> 00:56:08,760
I'll eat with them.

833
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,678
Okay.

834
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,436
I thought you'd need this.

835
00:56:17,436 --> 00:56:19,146
Oh, right. Yes.

836
00:56:19,855 --> 00:56:20,814
Enjoy your meal.

837
00:56:25,277 --> 00:56:27,779
What does I-na like?

838
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:31,366
I'll talk to her. It will be okay.

839
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:34,536
Anyway, what is this?

840
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,038
Oh, this...

841
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:41,043
{\an8}29,381 LIKES

842
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:43,712
{\an8}KI-BAEK AND CHO-HUI
THE FINAL DATE

843
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:46,423
{\an8}QUIT YOUR BAKERY
AND SHOW US KI-BAEK

844
00:56:46,423 --> 00:56:50,344
{\an8}SHE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT
SONG KI-BAEK, BUT HE IGNORES HER

845
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:51,637
{\an8}SHE STUDIED ABROAD, SERIOUSLY?

846
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:53,347
{\an8}WHY DOES SHE GET
SO MUCH MEDIA COVERAGE?

847
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:08,070
{\an8}KIM JU-YEON:
CHO-HUI, DID YOU SEE THIS?

848
00:57:28,131 --> 00:57:29,508
This is nice.

849
00:57:30,634 --> 00:57:34,596
I come here sometimes to help them
with their laundry and camp.

850
00:57:34,596 --> 00:57:38,350
But why laundry?
There are other volunteer opportunities.

851
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:44,189
Some seniors struggle with laundry.
This way they can sleep on clean bedding.

852
00:57:44,189 --> 00:57:47,109
When you do laundry,
your hard work doesn't betray you,

853
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:49,570
and you can see the results.
That's why I like it.

854
00:57:58,287 --> 00:57:59,288
Yesterday...

855
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:03,959
I wanted to comfort you.

856
00:58:06,044 --> 00:58:09,381
I just wanted to do something
for you, anything.

857
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:12,801
I was a little hurt.

858
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:17,347
You kept saying you were okay,
with a smile on your face.

859
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:25,188
But now that I've spent the whole day
with you here, I've realized...

860
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:32,321
that just being together makes you smile.

861
00:58:37,075 --> 00:58:41,288
It's my favorite face, my favorite smile.

862
00:58:43,874 --> 00:58:46,126
<i>You're not smiling because of me.</i>

863
00:58:47,502 --> 00:58:53,008
<i>On Woo-ju has to smile
because she wants to.</i>

864
00:58:53,008 --> 00:58:54,217
Enjoy!

865
00:58:57,137 --> 00:59:03,018
<i>Whether you want to smile or cry,
the decision should come from you.</i>

866
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:13,195
On Woo-ju,
you look really pretty when you smile.

867
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:17,240
But you look very pretty
even when you're not smiling.

868
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,246
So just do what you want.

869
00:59:23,246 --> 00:59:26,291
Smile when you want to,
and cry when you feel like it.

870
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:30,337
I'll be right by your side,
just like today.

871
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:38,679
It's fine if you want to say you're okay.

872
00:59:41,598 --> 00:59:44,059
And it's fine
if you want to say you're not okay.

873
00:59:55,445 --> 00:59:57,322
The stars look really pretty here.

874
01:00:05,956 --> 01:00:09,126
Come on. Not as pretty as On Woo-ju.

875
01:00:22,472 --> 01:00:24,307
I saw my mom.

876
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:28,812
My biological mother.

877
01:00:31,022 --> 01:00:33,108
My mother who abandoned me.

878
01:00:36,528 --> 01:00:39,239
And I've decided to leave
the <i>Couple's Paradise</i> team.

879
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:45,203
Everything will be all right
now that I've left the team.

880
01:00:52,919 --> 01:00:53,754
But I...

881
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:00,844
I'm not okay at all.

882
01:01:11,396 --> 01:01:12,272
I'm tired.

883
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:15,066
I should go to bed.

884
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:25,118
Can you sing me a lullaby?

885
01:01:41,343 --> 01:01:47,224
<i>When the mother goes to the isle</i>

886
01:01:48,975 --> 01:01:54,189
<i>To pick oysters</i>

887
01:01:55,649 --> 01:02:00,737
<i>The baby is left alone</i>

888
01:02:02,072 --> 01:02:07,118
<i>In the house</i>

889
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:14,251
<i>Listening to the lullaby</i>

890
01:02:16,002 --> 01:02:21,049
<i>From the sea</i>

891
01:02:24,135 --> 01:02:28,932
<i>The baby</i>

892
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:35,647
<i>Falls asleep</i>

893
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:43,864
<i>Even though the baby</i>

894
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:50,120
<i>Is fast asleep</i>

895
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:38,835
What the...

896
01:03:42,088 --> 01:03:44,591
Oh... You woke up.

897
01:03:53,224 --> 01:03:55,727
You shouldn't see that. It's...

898
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,812
{\an8}YEON
WHAT IS GOING ON?

899
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,734
What?

900
01:04:05,111 --> 01:04:05,946
What...

901
01:04:11,826 --> 01:04:12,661
What?

902
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:18,458
{\an8}COUPLE'S PARADISE!
EVERYTHING WAS A LIE?!

903
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:21,044
{\an8}COUPLE'S PARADISE WAS ALL A LIE

904

FRANKLY SPEAKING 💞 @ kissasian.one

905
01:04:41,106 --> 01:04:44,484
Mom! They say <i>Couple's Paradise</i>
was all rigged.

906
01:04:44,484 --> 01:04:46,403
Let's discuss what we're going to do.

907
01:04:47,195 --> 01:04:48,822
Is it true our show may not continue?

908
01:04:50,073 --> 01:04:52,158
On Woo-ju is the crazy bitch.

909
01:04:52,158 --> 01:04:54,869
<i>He's been reporting the haters
and replying to the comments.</i>

910
01:04:54,869 --> 01:04:57,455
<i>Does Un-baek like you?</i>

911
01:04:57,455 --> 01:04:59,582
Do you like him too?

912
01:04:59,582 --> 01:05:01,960
<i>Should I just retire?
Can I call myself successful?</i>

913
01:05:04,212 --> 01:05:06,131
<i>You must have an interview to explain it.</i>

914
01:05:06,131 --> 01:05:08,508
Are you and Ms. On Woo-ju together?

915
01:05:08,508 --> 01:05:09,426
Mr. An.

916
01:05:09,426 --> 01:05:11,177
<i>The switch is gone.</i>
