FRANKLY SPEAKING  💞 @ kissasian.one

2
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:32,362
Let's do it. This dating thing.

3
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:34,698
What is this? A prank?

4
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:37,576
Come on.
Let's give it a shot, this dating--

5
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:39,787
show.

6
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,918
{\an8}You've worked with me on a variety show.
In my current state--

7
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:48,086
{\an8}Back then, I didn't know you well.

8
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:50,172
{\an8}You should try things out
and see how it goes.

9
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:57,846
{\an8}Unless it's something like
<i>You Quiz</i> or <i>Hidden Singer</i>.

10
00:01:57,846 --> 00:02:01,308
{\an8}- You know, a show that requires a host.
- What?

11
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:04,186
{\an8}I can't go on <i>I Live Alone</i>
because I don't live alone.

12
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:06,522
I can't do <i>OIV</i>
because I don't have a manager.

13
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:13,070
My goodness. Someone's ambitious.

14
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,406
Do you think you can compete against
Yu Jae-seok or Jun Hyun-moo?

15
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,700
They're seasoned veterans.

16
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,206
If they're polar bears, I'd say you're
a baby penguin that just left its colony.

17
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:25,999
One that can't even walk properly yet.

18
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:31,296
Okay, so what's your point?

19
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:34,258
Reality dating show.

20
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:38,637
Regular people can participate too,
and it's definitely entertaining.

21
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:43,809
Most importantly,
I'm sure viewers will love the real you.

22
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,605
You said I was your switch.

23
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,357
So use me.

24
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,820
And I'll use you too.

25
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,203
A penguin can never encounter
a polar bear in its lifetime.

26
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:06,373
You know why?
Because penguins live in the Antarctic.

27
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,843
WORKMAN

28
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:26,810
Excuse me.

29
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:31,773
I told you to meet me in half an hour--

30
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:33,567
Well, I couldn't wait.

31
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,319
Hello, Dr. Kim.

32
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:40,365
{\an8}AGREEMENT

33
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:42,951
SONG KI-BAEK AND ON WOO-JU
WILL PERFORM THEIR DUTIES

34
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,704
Can't we just say
we'll trust each other and get on with it?

35
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:48,123
People sign agreements
to ensure everything goes well

36
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:50,125
and to address issues if they arise.

37
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:57,841
Well, you see. I'm a doctor, not a lawyer.

38
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:59,134
Why are you doing this?

39
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,430
Do you think I can be socially active
despite my disinhibition syndrome?

40
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,142
No, I mean, can I go on a TV show
in my current state?

41
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:13,232
Well, people go to work and school
with a broken arm or a broken skull.

42
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,359
That's life.

43
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,528
You're alive and breathing.
That's nice. Is Mr. Song dead?

44
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,322
See?

45
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:26,370
Let's collect some data first
with the switch on.

46
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,955
You should confront the problem.

47
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:37,965
We'll do it your style

48
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:40,634
and my style.

49
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:54,314
God, does this even make sense to you?

50
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:55,857
We got Kim Jeong-heon on board,

51
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:57,943
but you want to change
the concept altogether?

52
00:04:57,943 --> 00:05:00,904
What if Jeong-heon doesn't want to do it?

53
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:03,824
- Right now, we--
- Kim Jeong-heon is all we have.

54
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:04,992
That's why I'm doing this.

55
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,244
We're on the cliff's edge.

56
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:09,705
Viewers have seen
enough of Kim Jeong-heon.

57
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:11,581
We need something new and fresh.

58
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:13,875
Like what?

59
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,335
Do you have a concrete plan?

60
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:18,839
Kim Jeong-heon and Song Ki-baek.
There's something going on between them.

61
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,174
We'll have something
if we put those two together.

62
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:24,636
Okay, but even so,
do you think Jeong-heon would say yes?

63
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,221
Let's do it.

64
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:28,974
Sorry?

65
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:34,604
It's my chance to transition
from ideal son-in-law to ideal boyfriend.

66
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:36,690
We'll give it our all.

67
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:38,692
I'm counting on you, Ms. On.

68
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,949
Let's get started.

69
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,871
I'll hit the slate. One, two, three.

70
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:00,464
{\an8}<i>Hello, everyone. I'm Louis Kim.</i>

71
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,049
{\an8}<i>I'm 30 in Korean age.</i>

72
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:04,051
{\an8}I moved to France to study
when I was young.

73
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:08,305
{\an8}I currently run a small restaurant
that I own in Hannam-dong. I'm a chef.

74
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:12,601
{\an8}<i>I'm 29. It's a lovely age.</i>

75
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:13,810
{\an8}<i>I'm Choi Yu-yeong.</i>

76
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,815
{\an8}<i>I was a professional swimmer until age 23
and worked in TV up until recently.</i>

77
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:21,193
{\an8}Now I'm getting ready
to start my own business.

78
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:23,070
- Hello.
- Let me help you with that.

79
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,404
It's a little heavy.

80
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:25,405
It is kind of heavy.

81
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:28,241
{\an8}<i>I'm Park Seong-jun.</i>

82
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:30,827
{\an8}<i>I recently launched
a men's streetwear brand.</i>

83
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,204
{\an8}Our annual revenue...

84
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:36,291
I'm bashful about saying it myself,
but about ten billion won?

85
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,959
{\an8}I'm 25.

86
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,378
{\an8}<i>I'm Park Hae-ri.</i>

87
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:44,466
{\an8}<i>I'm a graphic designer
with 100k subscribers.</i>

88
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:46,802
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

89
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:48,303
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

90
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:51,139
{\an8}<i>I'm Cho Hui-seon.</i>

91
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,766
{\an8}I'm a lawyer.

92
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:56,645
{\an8}I used to work at a big law firm
but opened my own practice this year.

93
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:59,356
{\an8}<i>I've published a book,
and I give lectures on legal topics.</i>

94
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:00,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

95
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,900
- Take a seat.
- Shall we...

96
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:05,112
Send in the next guest.

97
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,087
Oh, someone else is here.

98
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:26,508
- Hello.
- Hello.

99
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:27,592
Hello.

100
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:30,720
- This way.
- Need a hand?

101
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,724
- He said he's good.
- This is awkward.

102
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,226
You can sit over here.

103
00:07:36,226 --> 00:07:37,352
You can sit...

104
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:40,814
Let's move on.

105
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,240
Oh, someone else is here.

106
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,700
Here, this way.

107
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,035
Oh, aren't you Jeong-heon?

108
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,876
- Hello.
- Hi.

109
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:03,545
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

110
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:04,713
Hello.

111
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:07,757
- Hello.
- Hello.

112
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:09,801
Hello.

113
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,678
I'm a fan of your shows.

114
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:12,762
Hello.

115
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:14,306
- This is cool.
- Wow.

116
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,058
- Are we supposed to stand?
- You can sit.

117
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:21,062
First, introduce yourselves.

118
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,614
Hello, I'm Park Seong-jun.

119
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,700
Applause, please.

120
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:39,456
I like women with pretty smiles.

121
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:41,791
- Louis Kim. I've seen him on Insta.
- Thank you.

122
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,376
He's famous.

123
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:46,171
I want to meet a successful man.

124
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:49,674
How about a business owner
that makes ten billion won annually?

125
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,680
It's nice to meet you guys.

126
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,393
Hey, Ki-baek.

127
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:02,854
Go ahead.

128
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:19,412
Hello, I'm Song Ki-baek, a JBC announcer.

129
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:22,332
Announcer?

130
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,920
I was at JBC for eight and a half years
but got kicked out

131
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,129
for causing trouble...

132
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:39,808
At the moment...

133
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:44,729
I'm un--

134
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,440
{\an8}FREELANCE ANNOUNCER

135
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:51,027
I'm free and unemployed.

136
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,163
Well, I'm here to try new things
with new people in a new environment.

137
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:05,083
But I see more cameras than people.

138
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,419
How do they expect us to date here?

139
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:17,262
- Oh, no.
- I want a love that's like a miracle.

140
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:20,890
Like a miracle.

141
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:23,560
Nice!

142
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,896
- He's not drunk, is he?
- I feel drunk all of a sudden.

143
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:29,733
Chin up.

144
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:46,499
So...

145
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:51,046
Hello, I'm Kim Jeong-heon.

146
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,348
That's it?

147
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:07,479
Such a cheeseball.

148
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,814
Come on. That should be in the teaser.

149
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,149
He's a total pro.

150
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:21,910
EPISODE 5: THE PRO AND THE AMATEUR

151
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,537
Okay, we'll now move on
to individual interviews.

152
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,831
You can make yourselves at home and chat.

153
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,795
- Where's your luggage?
- Over there.

154
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:33,588
Really? Let me go get it for you.

155
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:35,340
- Is your suitcase this one?
- That one.

156
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,675
Which one is yours?
I'll take it inside for you.

157
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:39,219
Thank you, I--

158
00:11:44,432 --> 00:11:45,433
You.

159
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:48,937
Yeah, as you promised.

160
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:50,271
The pinky?

161
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,524
You have to do a good job.

162
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:53,942
The best?

163
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:54,859
Okay?

164
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:57,946
I'm the best?

165
00:11:57,946 --> 00:11:59,406
Yes.

166
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:04,536
Wait!

167
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:08,873
I have an important announcement.

168
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:15,046
- Why do we have to put it back on?
- The crew wants to change the lapel mic.

169
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:17,715
I got this. I know how to do it.

170
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:18,967
It's faster if I do it.

171
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,601
Are you enjoying it so far?

172
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,979
Well, we're just getting started.

173
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:31,896
Right.

174
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:36,025
It's been forever since
the two of us stood together like this.

175
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,906
Don't you think it'll be better
to pair up these two?

176
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,325
There's something about being on set

177
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:45,618
and seeing you too.

178
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:48,121
It reminds me of the old days.

179
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,833
I don't want you
to think about the old days.

180
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:56,004
Hey, was I that obnoxious?

181
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,630
Everyone's so mean to me.

182
00:12:58,715 --> 00:12:59,841
I was obnoxious.

183
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:01,468
What?

184
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:02,802
I said, I was obnoxious.

185
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,351
Let me know if you need help.

186
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,188
I could be of help to you here.

187
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:15,023
All right.

188
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:23,364
Ki-baek.

189
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:25,700
Don't look at the camera.

190
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:30,121
I'm used to looking at the camera.
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:41,382
You can relax and sit comfortably.

192
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:45,136
Oh, this-- this side of my face
looks better on camera.

193
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:49,182
Please kindly edit out what I just said.

194
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,143
Requesting edits
will make us not want to do it.

195
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:55,188
Be it a humorous blunder or an error,
we want it in the show.

196
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,400
True, that's what variety shows are about.
That much I know.

197
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,735
Good point.

198
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:04,364
Just relax and tell me
whatever's on your mind.

199
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:06,574
I'll never make you look bad.

200
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,369
So? Who do you find most attractive?

201
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:11,746
- We met just an hour ago.
- What?

202
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:17,210
I mean, I know--
I know that's what we're here to do,

203
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,754
to say "I like you" an hour
after meeting each other.

204
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:23,758
I'm very nervous right now.

205
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:29,347
This question shouldn't make you nervous.
This should be a little easier.

206
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,518
Why did you decide to do this show?

207
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,103
I couldn't go on <i>You Quiz.</i>

208
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:42,610
I mean, I'm a penguin.

209
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,071
A penguin?

210
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:47,115
I see. You're a penguin.

211
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:48,783
A penguin.

212
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,703
What am I supposed to say to this?

213
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:55,206
Is he trying to flaunt his charm?

214
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:59,252
Like, trying to say he's cute
and fluffy like a penguin?

215
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,760
All right. Calm down and think, okay?

216
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,096
What is it that you have to do here?

217
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:12,015
I need to find my match.

218
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:14,601
I may look like a loser
because of my current situation,

219
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:18,688
but I've been on many blind dates.
I have many qualities that women like.

220
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,315
I'm tall and...

221
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,233
I mean, I'm tall--

222
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:24,819
and I went to a good school.

223
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,446
And my job...

224
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,448
Well, I had a good job.

225
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:30,825
You're not getting the point.

226
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,494
This is a reality dating show.

227
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:36,873
You need to have the qualities
the viewers want in a man.

228
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:39,375
People watch reality dating shows

229
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,171
to see the difficult, competitive process
of winning someone's heart.

230
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:45,548
That said, the most important thing is...

231
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:47,050
What is it?

232
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,676
Victory.

233
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:51,429
Whether it's a game or a mission,
you must win.

234
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,015
Good point.

235
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:56,059
The second most important is loyalty.

236
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,937
In a show where people
are put through emotional turmoil,

237
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:03,983
a loyal man who never betrays you
tends to be more popular.

238
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:06,903
"He won, and he's loyal?
He sure is a keeper."

239
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:08,863
Victory and loyalty.

240
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:12,700
Of course, some might try to rub others
the wrong way to grab attention,

241
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,120
but it's something only pros can do,
so don't you even dream of it.

242
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,914
But victory and loyalty.

243
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:20,541
They both require intense energy,

244
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,919
so you need something soft as well.

245
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,879
Show them you also have some <i>yudori</i>

246
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:27,882
and surprise them.

247
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:32,929
The three key traits of Mr. Popular
on variety shows. The three keys.

248
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:37,058
THE 3 KEY TRAITS
= VICTORY, LOYALTY, YUDORI

249
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:41,062
Victory, loyalty and <i>yudori?</i>
For <i>yudori</i>, let's say flexibility instead.

250
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:45,525
Or a relaxed attitude.
It's a Japanese loanword.

251
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,651
Oh, right.

252
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,120
THE FIRST GAME
TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE

253
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,457
{\an8}<i>Once the game begins,
one of the guys will be eliminated,</i>

254
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:04,544
<i>and the girls will choose their matches.</i>

255
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:07,005
{\an8}<i>The ladies will each have
a balloon on their backs.</i>

256
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,007
{\an8}<i>If the balloon pops, the team is out.</i>

257
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:12,135
The last team remaining
in the pit is the winner

258
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:15,388
{\an8}and will be given a huge advantage.

259
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:16,305
{\an8}COUPLE'S PARADISE

260
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:31,154
Good luck! Let's go!

261
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,405
Good luck!

262
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,038
{\an8}VICTORY

263
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:55,970
Let's do this!

264
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:20,995
There you go.

265
00:18:20,995 --> 00:18:23,247
They're so competitive right off the bat.

266
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,833
They can't just date
when the camera starts rolling.

267
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,545
You need to spark their competitiveness.
Dating can be embarrassing, but not this.

268
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:33,341
Once they get competitive,
they'll begin to develop some feelings.

269
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:34,550
That's right.

270
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,596
Ladies, go ahead and pick the person
you want to team up with.

271
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,268
Jeong-heon.

272
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:02,245
Ki-baek, can you help me down?

273
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:03,329
Oh, sure.

274
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:07,125
All right. We got this.

275
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,085
Yes. Hold tight.

276
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:31,232
Hold tight!

277
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:37,280
Right there!

278
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,493
Go for it!

279
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:47,748
- Well done.
- Nice. Good work.

280
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,544
Nice, we did it. Well done.

281
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:04,140
Song Ki-baek. Don't tire yourself out.
Slow down.

282
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:06,392
Slow down? What do you mean?

283
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,062
- Let's give them the picture they want.
- The picture they want?

284
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:14,817
I guess you're suggesting we rig the game.
You're messing with the wrong guy.

285
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:17,778
You think I'm messing with you
when I'm trying to help you?

286
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:19,530
Seriously, I can't talk to you.

287
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:23,868
Shut your mouth. What do you know?

288
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:47,308
- It popped!
- It popped.

289
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:48,935
We beat them.

290
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:50,561
We won!

291
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:54,649
- I won! We won!
- We won!

292
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,318
We're done.

293
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:03,157
We won!

294
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:08,162
I thought I was watching an action film.

295
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:11,415
Well, they've secured enough screen time.

296
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,960
Wow, Song Ki-baek is fiercely competitive.

297
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:17,380
Hey, right now.
That look on his face. Get it on camera.

298
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:21,425
Nice. I love that look
on Kim Jeong-heon's face too.

299
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:25,012
Now this is what I call a fierce showdown
between men, you know?

300
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:26,138
Yes.

301
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:49,370
- Are you okay?
- Good work.

302
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:53,291
We'll freshen up and meet back here.

303
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:57,920
Hey, Ki-baek.

304
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:01,882
If the bathrooms are full,
you can use ours.

305
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,467
Oh, thanks.

306
00:22:08,764 --> 00:22:09,640
- Woo-ju.
- Yes?

307
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,767
Are you interviewing Kim Jeong-heon?

308
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:14,103
- Sure.
- All right.

309
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:23,654
Seriously, I can't believe this.

310
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:25,781
You said I was hungry for attention.

311
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:28,242
You begged me, in tears,
not to go on the show.

312
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:32,788
You already met another girl?
You really are a piece of garbage!

313
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:37,043
I'm sick and tired of this too.

314
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:38,753
Let's just break up. If we end--

315
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:45,426
Wait, Ki-baek.

316
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:51,640
Sorry for disturbing you.

317
00:22:52,808 --> 00:22:53,768
You heard everything?

318
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:54,894
Yes, I did.

319
00:22:54,894 --> 00:22:57,354
Are you going to tell the production team?

320
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:01,776
Why would I? I'm not the type
to go out of my way to stir up trouble.

321
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:08,866
So, does it mean I've just lost a guy?

322
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:12,495
Yes, you just broke up with him.
I heard everything.

323
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,623
No, I'm talking about you.

324
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,169
I bet you now have no feelings
for me whatsoever.

325
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,254
I never had feelings for you.

326
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,798
- What?
- Sorry?

327
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:28,719
So you weren't interested in me?

328
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:30,304
No.

329
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:33,140
Then who...

330
00:23:33,808 --> 00:23:37,603
Well, I'm not sure yet.

331
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:43,818
Oh, I looked for you to give you this.

332
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:49,073
I noticed you fell
during the game earlier.

333
00:23:49,073 --> 00:23:51,659
Oh, no. You're hurt.

334
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,330
I should've protected you.

335
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,749
I guess I got
a little too worked up. I'm sorry.

336
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:06,215
Well, I owe you one,

337
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:10,094
so I promise I'll choose you
in the first round.

338
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:13,430
It'd be nice if you could choose me too.

339
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:15,558
Let's be loyal to each other.

340
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:21,897
<i>A loyal man who never betrays you
tends to be more popular.</i>

341
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:24,400
LOYALTY

342
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:27,153
Anyway, when did you see this?

343
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:30,656
Well, just now.

344
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:38,539
You know...

345
00:24:44,712 --> 00:24:46,297
<i>I find Choi Yu-yeong attractive.</i>

346
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:48,632
Yu-yeong?

347
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:52,094
Yes. She smiles a lot and seems easygoing.

348
00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:55,598
I thought there was good chemistry
between you and Hui-seon.

349
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:59,268
Well, I like people who are fun.

350
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:04,648
So, you find Yu-yeong more fun.

351
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:14,200
Why did you, everyone's ideal son-in-law,
decide to come on a dating show?

352
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:26,128
The ideal son-in-law title is nice,
as is being everyone's favorite host.

353
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:29,089
I'm grateful for everything,
but it felt like something was...

354
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:33,052
missing in my life.

355
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:36,764
So for the first time in my life,
I turned around and looked back,

356
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,351
then saw something
I wanted back in my life.

357
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,441
I guess you'll have to edit this out.

358
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,569
Then...

359
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,658
I'm here because I now want to be
everyone's ideal boyfriend.

360
00:25:57,368 --> 00:25:58,369
I see.

361
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:00,579
The winners will go get the hint.

362
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,960
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

363
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,011
- Here, hold my hand.
- Thank you.

364
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:24,144
Can we finish this in time?

365
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:28,941
Watch your step.

366
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:33,320
- Hey, Min-gu.
- Yes.

367
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,989
What's everyone else doing?

368
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:36,699
They all paired up and went out.

369
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:39,827
- Really? Who got left out among the guys?
- Song Ki-baek.

370
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:41,370
Who's with him?

371
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,956
He wanted to rest.
I'll head back once I'm done here.

372
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:45,582
How could you leave him alone?

373
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,418
For God's sake.

374
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:48,919
I'm sorry.

375
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,214
We'll stick to the plan.

376
00:26:54,174 --> 00:26:55,175
Sorry about that.

377
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:02,558
{\an8}HEAVEN HOUSE

378
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:09,231
Man, I'm so frazzled.

379
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:14,153
Honestly, Kim Jeong-heon's going to make
the others look like fools.

380
00:27:14,153 --> 00:27:16,155
What? Why? Song Ki-baek is here too.

381
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:19,992
I heard he's why
<i>Men on the Run</i> got canceled.

382
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:21,452
Oh, really?

383
00:27:21,452 --> 00:27:24,413
Did he bribe the head writer or something?

384
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:25,622
Hold on.

385
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,624
Maybe he bribed her with something else.

386
00:27:27,624 --> 00:27:29,418
- Like what?
- Well, you know.

387
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:31,754
- What?
- Is your mind in the gutter?

388
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:33,505
- No, it's not.
- Mr. Song.

389
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:44,308
What are you doing...

390
00:27:47,853 --> 00:27:49,104
Hello, Ms. On Woo-ju.

391
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,983
This is our first time chatting
outside of those meetings.

392
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,737
What are you talking about--

393
00:27:56,737 --> 00:28:00,366
I know you absolutely hate befriending
the cast members on your shows.

394
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:03,118
I must say, I almost took it personally.

395
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:06,705
But kudos to you for keeping your work
and personal life separate.

396
00:28:07,498 --> 00:28:08,749
What is this nonsense--

397
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:12,169
Ms. On, just do what you normally do.

398
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:17,049
Go ahead and neglect me, as usual.

399
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:19,343
Neglect you? Me?

400
00:28:19,927 --> 00:28:22,221
Oh, we're understaffed right now, so--

401
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:23,389
It's fine.

402
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:26,392
Keep neglecting me, as usual.

403
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:30,562
Since we're not close at all,
I ask you to keep neglecting me.

404
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:35,567
Go do what you need to do.

405
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,986
I need some alone time,
so you can get going.

406
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:39,947
Yes, go. Go on.

407
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:42,074
Go on.

408
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:45,369
I'll see you later at the shoot.

409
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:11,854
My goodness.

410
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:15,315
I've never seen someone

411
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:18,694
with such severe seasickness
in the 30 years I've been a fisherman.

412
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:21,947
And he's a big guy who looks like he could
catch a whale with his bare hands.

413
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,532
Hurry up, will you?

414
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:26,744
Gross! What the heck is he doing?

415
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:33,125
I hate you, Mom!

416
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:40,841
When celebrities have a shoot,
don't their fans send

417
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:43,802
coffee trucks
and other goodies to the set?

418
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:44,970
That's right.

419
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,388
How much does it cost?

420
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:48,515
Let's find out.

421
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,936
It's 1.2 million won?

422
00:29:54,146 --> 00:29:55,189
It's 1.2 million?

423
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,649
Why? Do you want to start
a fan club for Ki-baek?

424
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:02,237
That's cool. Very cool.

425
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:08,660
What?

426
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,828
Why would you come here?

427
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:11,997
You're here?

428
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,041
A coffee truck?

429
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:17,836
Where?

430
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:24,927
I can have a cup of coffee and relax?

431
00:30:27,596 --> 00:30:28,722
Time to relax.

432
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:38,774
Damn it.

433
00:30:41,902 --> 00:30:42,903
Excuse me.

434
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:48,867
- Yes?
- Where's the set for <i>Couples Paradise?</i>

435
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,174
You're not allowed to sell
these things here.

436
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:06,677
Please leave, okay?

437
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:08,762
I'm not here to sell stuff.

438
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:11,390
I'm Song Ki-baek's brother.

439
00:31:13,642 --> 00:31:14,643
I see.

440
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:16,687
Come with me.

441
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:22,901
Don't litter your cigarette butts.

442
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:24,027
Sorry.

443
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:26,113
No cigarette butts!

444
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:27,447
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

445
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:37,916
Hey, Un-baek.

446
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,626
- Check the other room.
- Thanks.

447
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:46,133
Mom missed work to make these.
It was nuts.

448
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:51,680
No, no. When I drink coffee...

449
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:57,060
RELAXED ATTITUDE

450
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,186
Let's go.

451
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:03,775
What are you doing?

452
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:05,611
Okay.

453
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,197
RELAXED ATTITUDE

454
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:15,621
You're a big guy,
yet you can't even pull this?

455
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:17,623
You need to work out.

456
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:21,835
Hold on.

457
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,547
Will this be enough?

458
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:29,968
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Enjoy.

459
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:32,179
- Thank you.
- No problem. Enjoy.

460
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:33,263
Dig in.

461
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:35,557
Yes.

462
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:38,769
I told you not to go overboard.
Are you advertising that a celeb is here?

463
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:40,395
What is this?

464
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:41,480
ENJOY THE FOOD

465
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,898
Why did you make another sign?

466
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:44,983
Is it that obvious? I'm glad.

467
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:48,028
I've only seen stuff like this on TV.

468
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:49,321
Jeong-heon, you're so cool.

469
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:51,406
Jeong-heon, you really are a celebrity.

470
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:53,367
I guess I am.

471
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:54,451
Have some food. Enjoy.

472
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:55,535
Thank you.

473
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:58,163
- Enjoy. Yes.
- Enjoy.

474
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:01,041
What are you doing?

475
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,378
Mom missed work
and stayed up all night to make these.

476
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:06,755
I don't want them to spoil.

477
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:08,715
Hey.

478
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,343
Or is it that you're embarrassed?

479
00:33:11,343 --> 00:33:13,261
Hey, why would I be embarrassed?

480
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:14,638
We'll have them later.

481
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:18,892
Hey, come on. I know you're embarrassed.

482
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,811
Seriously.

483
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:24,398
Damn it, I'm an idiot
for lugging them all the way here.

484
00:33:24,982 --> 00:33:26,274
- Ki-baek, what's that?
- Hey.

485
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:27,401
Is that rice punch?

486
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,486
- Yes.
- Nice, can I have some?

487
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:30,654
Oh, sure thing.

488
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:33,031
Is this homemade rice punch?

489
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:34,741
Yes, it is.

490
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:37,285
Is this really homemade?

491
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,037
- Yes, help yourself.
- Whoa.

492
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:41,790
- I'll take one.
- Awesome.

493
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,333
- Help yourself.
- What's this?

494
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,251
What is it?

495
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:45,460
- Come here.
- Rice punch.

496
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,420
Have some.

497
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,337
Homemade rice punch.

498
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:48,547
This is so awesome.

499
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:50,215
- Awesome.
- Seung-hyeon.

500
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:51,758
- Come on.
- There are snacks.

501
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,388
- You and Geum-bi go over there.
- All right.

502
00:33:56,388 --> 00:33:57,472
Come with me.

503
00:33:57,472 --> 00:33:59,099
- But--
- This way.

504
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:04,688
- The rice punch is good.
- Last one.

505
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:05,605
Oh, yes.

506
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:11,319
Yes, make sure you don't skip meals.

507
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:13,071
All right.

508
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:19,119
God, you scared me.

509
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:21,788
May I help you?

510
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:29,421
We met earlier.
I'm Song Ki-baek's brother. Hello.

511
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:30,547
Yes, hi.

512
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:34,718
Do you have something to tell me?

513
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:40,015
It's for you.

514
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,979
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF KI-BAEK

515
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,274
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

516
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:51,651
Do you have some time?

517
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:54,780
- Pardon me?
- Do you have some time right now?

518
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:58,158
Well...

519
00:34:58,158 --> 00:34:59,618
- There are snacks.
- Give me some.

520
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:02,496
It's good. It's homemade rice punch.

521
00:35:02,496 --> 00:35:04,122
- Can I have this?
- It's so good.

522
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:05,373
Hey, try it.

523
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:06,875
You had coffee earlier.

524
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:07,959
Hey, that's not fair.

525
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:15,801
Eat up.

526
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:17,135
Hey, you guys--

527
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:18,887
Who wants the green tangerine flavor?

528
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:21,098
- It's tomato juice.
- Tomato.

529
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:23,391
- Tomato juice.
- Here's some more rice punch.

530
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,019
- Thank you.
- No problem.

531
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:27,521
- Thank you!
- No problem.

532
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:32,275
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

533
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:34,069
Oh, Ki-baek! They're so popular.

534
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:35,320
They're gone.

535
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:41,910
Oh, no. They're gone. Bummer.

536
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:45,622
This is the last one.

537
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:47,082
It's green tangerine juice.

538
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,209
Here.

539
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:50,669
Thank you.

540
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:52,462
It's cute.

541
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:56,299
We're all ready for the evening, right?

542
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:59,469
- We're almost ready.
- Hey, Ki-baek. Say cheese.

543
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:05,851
One more time. Cheese.

544
00:36:08,436 --> 00:36:10,564
So, it's a wrap for today.

545
00:36:10,564 --> 00:36:13,275
The guys can return to their rooms,

546
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:15,861
or feel free to stay here
to enjoy the food and drinks.

547
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:17,904
Good work today.

548
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:19,072
- Thank you.
- Great work.

549
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,282
- Good work.
- Thank you.

550
00:36:21,074 --> 00:36:22,242
Let's clink our glasses.

551
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:24,786
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

552
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:33,253
It's okay. We'll take care of that.

553
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:35,088
Don't worry about it. This is my job.

554
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:39,467
Director Chae gave him a job
since we're understaffed.

555
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:42,846
I came voluntarily.

556
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:45,515
I missed the last ferry.

557
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:54,733
- Where are you going?
- We're done for the day, so I'm off.

558
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:58,153
Done for the day?
Says who? We are not done.

559
00:37:00,363 --> 00:37:03,241
The crew is all gone,
so the real fun begins now.

560
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,244
- Pour me one too.
- Sure.

561
00:37:14,377 --> 00:37:15,378
Cheers.

562
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:17,297
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

563
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:18,840
Ki-baek. Let me pour you one.

564
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,467
Oh, I'm good.

565
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,676
You can't drink?

566
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:23,637
Well, my stomach is a little upset.

567
00:37:23,637 --> 00:37:24,554
Oh, no.

568
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:26,139
By the way,

569
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:29,392
she said all the guys had one shocking
thing in common. What could it be?

570
00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:31,728
<i>I have an important announcement.</i>

571
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:34,689
The four guys here
have something in common.

572
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:37,651
You'll find it quite shocking.

573
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:40,570
Find out what it is.

574
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,781
If you figure out what it is,

575
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:46,493
you'll be given a huge advantage.

576
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:48,078
Do you know each other personally?

577
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,417
Oh, from the military?

578
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:56,127
I served in the army.

579
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:57,545
- Marine Corps.
- I got an exemption.

580
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:58,880
I served in the air force.

581
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:01,675
- Your MBTI type?
- ENTJ.

582
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:02,926
ISFP.

583
00:38:02,926 --> 00:38:04,511
- What's that?
- No idea.

584
00:38:04,511 --> 00:38:06,638
Maybe you all have the same birthday?

585
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:08,181
- Mine's in October.
- Me too.

586
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:10,016
Oh, mine too.

587
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:13,478
Mine's in September.

588
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:18,775
If it was that easy, they wouldn't have
turned it into a mission like this.

589
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:22,279
How are we supposed to figure it out
when you guys have no idea whatsoever?

590
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:25,615
We should put our heads together
and figure it out. Right?

591
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:28,576
Jeong-heon.

592
00:38:29,494 --> 00:38:31,538
What was the hint you and Hui-seon got?

593
00:38:31,538 --> 00:38:32,706
Can't you tell us?

594
00:38:32,706 --> 00:38:33,957
Sorry?

595
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,129
Okay. Well, it is important to put
our heads together at a time like this.

596
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,052
Here.

597
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:48,346
What is this?

598
00:38:49,556 --> 00:38:50,807
Anyone know what it means?

599
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:52,809
- You? Any ideas?
- No clue.

600
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,316
That cat looks very familiar.

601
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:04,154
- You scared me.
- Why are there so many mosquitoes here?

602
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:06,740
Shoot. Hold on.

603
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,994
There are so many mosquitoes.

604
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:12,662
- Please.
- If I spray it here--

605
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:13,997
I might die first.

606
00:39:13,997 --> 00:39:15,123
Oh, hold on.

607
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:17,500
I see one here.

608
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,969
Sorry, are you okay?

609
00:39:29,763 --> 00:39:32,349
No, I am not okay.

610
00:39:35,435 --> 00:39:37,812
Hey, you said your stomach was upset.

611
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,441
Microphone check, one, two.

612
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,611
Guys, let's sing!

613
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:48,490
{\an8}Hae-ri likes Kim Jeong-heon, right?

614
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:52,619
I tried to sound her out in the interview.
She said she was a fan.

615
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:53,703
WHO LIKES WHOM

616
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:55,372
We have a triangle here.

617
00:39:55,372 --> 00:39:57,123
Can you put this in full-screen mode?

618
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:02,253
I think it's safe to say Hui-seon
and Seong-jun are already a couple.

619
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:03,922
Choi Yu-yeong.

620
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:05,924
<i>She likes Kim Jeong-heon,</i>

621
00:40:05,924 --> 00:40:08,093
<i>but she was giving
Song Ki-baek this look.</i>

622
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:12,097
If it's Kim Jeong-heon, Song Ki-baek
and Choi Yu-yeong,

623
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:15,892
I'd say we should go for it
as the show's main love triangle.

624
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,188
As if Kim Jeong-heon would play along.
It's all for show.

625
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:23,024
- It'll be fun.
- It'll be fun.

626
00:40:28,196 --> 00:40:31,741
<i>Whatever you want to hear
I'll whisper it in your ear</i>

627
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:33,201
<i>- I love you
- I love you</i>

628
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:34,369
<i>With your lips</i>

629
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:37,622
<i>Tell me, tell me softly now
In my ear</i>

630
00:40:37,622 --> 00:40:38,540
Get married!

631
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,457
<i>Tell me softly...</i>

632
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:42,377
- I-na is there, right?
- She'll line up the song and come back.

633
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:44,045
Okay, let's go!

634
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:46,339
I had to throw in this Easter egg.

635
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:48,049
Get it? Pretty please?

636
00:40:52,846 --> 00:40:54,264
"PRO AND AMATEUR"
BY ROO'RA

637
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:01,604
Who lined up this song?

638
00:41:01,604 --> 00:41:04,065
It wasn't me.

639
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,901
- Why does it sound familiar?
- How do I know this song?

640
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:09,821
Okay.

641
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:16,661
SONG KI-BAEK

00:41:17,328 --> 00:41:18,830
<i>I can do anything and everything</i>

643
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,040
<i>I can make you love me</i>

644
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,917
<i>I can touch your heart</i>

645
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,794
<i>I can give you
All the love in the world</i>

646
00:41:24,794 --> 00:41:27,088
<i>I can make you come to me and love me</i>

647
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:28,840
<i>It's nothing hard</i>

648
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,967
<i>I know when to end things
And how to leave you</i>

649
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:33,052
<i>There's nothing I don't know
I know everything</i>

650
00:41:33,052 --> 00:41:36,556
<i>We first met like it was</i>

651
00:41:36,556 --> 00:41:40,852
<i>A coincidental joke
And we talked</i>

652
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:47,484
<i>Your words captured my heart</i>

653
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:51,488
It's nice to sing this after so long.

654
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:52,989
Did you line it up?

655
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:56,784
Hey, variety shows are all about
who gets more screen time.

656
00:41:56,784 --> 00:42:00,246
Stop dwelling on the news show where
the camera was always zoomed in on you.

657
00:42:00,872 --> 00:42:02,248
Listen when I'm talking.

658
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:11,549
<i>I'm crying this much
Because I wanted to trust you</i>

659
00:42:12,592 --> 00:42:19,390
<i>I thought I'd never trade you
For anything in this world</i>

660
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:24,062
<i>Who can I talk to?</i>

661
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:27,815
<i>Would anyone understand the truth?</i>

662
00:42:29,651 --> 00:42:31,152
They all seem buzzed, right?

663
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:33,363
God, they're all totally drunk now.

664
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:35,490
Talk about good timing.

665
00:42:37,534 --> 00:42:38,660
Send the message.

666
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:42,539
MESSAGE THE PERSON
YOU FEEL MOST ATTRACTED TO

667
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:44,832
Check your phone. They just texted us.

668
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:48,795
<i>I want to go out into the world too</i>

669
00:42:48,795 --> 00:42:55,385
<i>I want to show you my dreams
With confidence</i>

670
00:42:55,385 --> 00:42:59,472
<i>My wings, I haven't been able to spread</i>

671
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:01,766
Wow, you're good.

672
00:43:01,766 --> 00:43:02,809
You're like a pro.

673
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:05,270
Right? He's like a singer.
My ears are happy.

674
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,980
He's really good.

675
00:43:09,232 --> 00:43:12,860
<i>I want to fly</i>

676
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:15,947
I'm so impressed.

677
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:18,032
He's a really good singer.

678
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:20,743
That's our shared phone, right?

679
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:21,786
Yes.

680
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:24,080
- Did someone already text back?
- Park Seong-jun.

681
00:43:24,747 --> 00:43:27,792
"Hui-seon, the moment I first saw you,

682
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:31,212
your intelligent and pure vibes
lit up ten billion stars in my heart."

683
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:33,923
Ten billion stars? As in ten billion won?

684
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:36,175
It's anonymous but he's so obvious.

685
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:38,678
Forward the messages
to the correct recipients.

686
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:39,762
Will do.

687
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:41,681
- I-na.
- Yes.

688
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:43,641
Hey, Min-gu. Pass me the phone.

689
00:43:46,144 --> 00:43:47,228
What about Song Ki-baek?

690
00:43:48,688 --> 00:43:50,982
He's still like a deer in headlights.

691
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:55,653
- We'll try to get him with Yu-yeong.
- I think he's already fallen for her.

692
00:43:56,237 --> 00:43:57,614
- Really?
- How do you know?

693
00:43:57,614 --> 00:43:59,240
When we were having snacks...

694
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:01,743
Woo-ju, you saw that too, right?

695
00:44:01,743 --> 00:44:02,994
You were there too.

696
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:04,704
Oh, yeah.

697
00:44:05,872 --> 00:44:09,167
It's green tangerine juice. Here.

698
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:12,503
Thank you. It's cute.

699
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:15,548
He did that?

700
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:18,968
He must really like her then.

701
00:44:18,968 --> 00:44:20,887
He knew the camera wasn't rolling.

702
00:44:21,846 --> 00:44:24,724
But how come we haven't heard back
from Song Ki-baek yet?

703
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:29,771
MESSAGE THE PERSON
YOU FEEL MOST ATTRACTED TO

704
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:35,818
It'd be nice if you could choose me too.

705
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:37,612
Let's be loyal to each other.

706
00:44:40,782 --> 00:44:44,369
<i>Cute, cute
You're so cute when you smile</i>

707
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:47,580
<i>You're so adorable, my darling</i>

708
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:50,041
<i>You're so cool</i>

709
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:53,753
<i>You look so dashing
That my heart is fluttering like...</i>

710
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:03,471
<i>I'm learning how to swim
So I won't drown in your eyes</i>

711
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:06,724
YU-YEONG HAS SEAWEED STUCK
IN HER STRAIGHT, WHITE TEETH

712
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:13,314
{\an8}YU-YEONG HAS SEAWEED
STUCK IN HER TEETH

713
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:19,987
{\an8}CHOI, TEETH, SEAWEED

714
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,323
{\an8}YU-YEONG, GET THAT SEAWEED
OUT OF YOUR TEETH

715
00:45:40,758 --> 00:45:42,135
What's this?

716
00:45:45,054 --> 00:45:46,097
Look in the mirror?

717
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:48,808
Oh, because she's good-looking?

718
00:45:48,808 --> 00:45:50,309
He thinks she's pretty.

719
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:51,769
Did he write anything else?

720
00:45:52,937 --> 00:45:54,897
What is this? What does he want?

721
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:57,191
Maybe he's not finished.

722
00:45:57,191 --> 00:46:00,194
I-na, go and see if Yu-yeong has
something on her face.

723
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,737
Me?

724
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,406
Yes, you.

725
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:13,291
<i>I'm Louis Kim. Just call me Louis.
I'm 30 in Korean age.</i>

726
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:14,750
<i>I recently launched--</i>

727
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,689
<i>Ladies, you can--</i>

728
00:47:05,843 --> 00:47:07,303
Jesus Christ!

729
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:09,263
You scared the crap out of me.

730
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:14,769
They're here to date,
and we're here to work.

731
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:16,062
You know that, right?

732
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:19,941
What-- Yeah, of course.

733
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:23,611
As a writer, you should never look
at any of them too fondly,

734
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:25,655
or hate any of them for that matter.

735
00:47:25,655 --> 00:47:28,783
I do not want to see romance in your eyes
when we're working, okay?

736
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:31,953
What are you talking about?

737
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:35,748
Well, Ha-young said
she'd prod Ki-baek into action for sure,

738
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:37,375
so snap out of it.

739
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:39,252
Okay?

740
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,447
{\an8}HEAVEN HOUSE

741
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,616
{\an8}You didn't get a single message, did you?

742
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:11,909
{\an8}NO ONE CHOSE YOU

743
00:48:11,909 --> 00:48:15,621
{\an8}By the way,
why did you send a message like that?

744
00:48:18,082 --> 00:48:19,542
It's not like I wanted to do it.

745
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:20,876
But you wrote it.

746
00:48:22,545 --> 00:48:24,380
What are you talking about? Are you okay?

747
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:26,799
I'm sorry.

748
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,052
It's fine if you want to
come across as quirky,

749
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:32,805
but you need to
at least get your message across.

750
00:48:32,805 --> 00:48:34,098
Seriously.

751
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:35,891
What was that? That was so random.

752
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:38,144
Hey, turn off the camera.

753
00:48:40,021 --> 00:48:41,355
We still have time.

754
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:44,483
We can film your interview anytime.

755
00:48:45,776 --> 00:48:47,653
Just relax and be yourself.

756
00:48:48,404 --> 00:48:50,615
You're doing your job very well right now.

757
00:48:52,283 --> 00:48:53,701
My job?

758
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:55,494
You're provoking Kim Jeong-heon.

759
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:01,751
Are you saying my role here is
to provoke Kim Jeong-heon?

760
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:03,544
That's your weapon.

761
00:49:04,128 --> 00:49:06,839
Stay right next to him,
even going forward.

762
00:49:07,673 --> 00:49:10,676
And it wouldn't be a bad idea
to play a villain, if you can do it.

763
00:49:10,676 --> 00:49:12,511
You know enough about showbiz.

764
00:49:12,511 --> 00:49:13,763
When playing a minor role,

765
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:16,515
it helps to craft an image
that is conspicuous and loud.

766
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:42,750
Mr. Song.

767
00:49:44,126 --> 00:49:47,171
You're doing a great job.

768
00:49:48,422 --> 00:49:49,423
Am I?

769
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:53,928
Am I doing my job well?

770
00:49:54,553 --> 00:49:55,554
Yes, of course.

771
00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:02,645
Ms. On.

772
00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:12,530
What was the potential you saw in me?

773
00:50:14,365 --> 00:50:17,743
I told you. With your
heartfelt emotions and sincerity--

774
00:50:17,743 --> 00:50:19,120
No, not that.

775
00:50:20,037 --> 00:50:21,163
The real goal.

776
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:24,709
What?

777
00:50:26,752 --> 00:50:27,753
Forget it.

778
00:50:31,674 --> 00:50:32,675
But...

779
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:48,315
Well, the trails aren't hard going at all,

780
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:52,987
so just think that you're going hiking
as a couple and follow the trails.

781
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:58,284
Follow the trail we built,
and you'll see a blue shed.

782
00:50:58,284 --> 00:51:03,372
Inside, you'll find a hint for the quiz,
so make sure you bring it with you.

783
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:05,124
We'll get going now.

784
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,339
I didn't know we'd draw names
to choose partners.

785
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:14,508
Ki-baek, are we meant to be or something?

786
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:19,430
I don't know about that,
but I know someone's not loyal.

787
00:51:21,015 --> 00:51:24,435
Oh, I have such weak cell reception here.

788
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:26,020
I swear I sent you a message.

789
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:28,063
I wonder what happened.

790
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:31,400
Come on. Let's go.

791
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:54,131
They said we were going hiking.

792
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:57,676
Why is it so spooky here?

793
00:51:58,427 --> 00:52:00,930
Well, I guess
this isn't an ordinary hiking trail.

794
00:52:08,187 --> 00:52:10,815
Oh, should we follow Jeong-heon too?

795
00:52:13,025 --> 00:52:16,570
No, we'll go our own way.

796
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,738
What?

797
00:52:18,697 --> 00:52:20,908
But everyone else is going that way.

798
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:29,834
The couples' hiking adventure has begun.
Spook them and lure them to the shed.

799
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:31,877
Is the special effects team on standby?

800
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:33,462
That path looks easier.

801
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:35,798
It's better to go this way. Trust me.

802
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:53,649
Un-baek, don't do that here.
Do it over there.

803
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:55,317
Okay.

804
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:02,992
Un-baek.

805
00:53:03,742 --> 00:53:05,995
Not too close.
They should reach over there.

806
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:07,913
Okay, I got it.

807
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,377
Oh, they're here.

808
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:14,712
- Here they come!
- Hide!

809
00:53:29,435 --> 00:53:31,854
What is this place? It's so spooky here.

810
00:53:33,814 --> 00:53:35,107
Don't you feel cold?

811
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:37,401
Oh, this is--

812
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:41,488
It's like the hidden camera prank,
which you often see on variety shows.

813
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:43,657
Just stay calm and follow me.

814
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,702
I am following you, but...

815
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:50,331
What?

816
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:53,709
My God! Ki-baek, your face.

817
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:54,668
What?

818
00:53:54,668 --> 00:53:56,128
My face?

819
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:57,588
What about it? Why?

820
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:59,423
Hurry up and follow me.

821
00:54:00,716 --> 00:54:02,301
- What is it?
- Come on!

822
00:54:02,301 --> 00:54:04,637
Why? What about my face? What is it?

823
00:54:04,637 --> 00:54:05,763
Wait up.

824
00:54:05,763 --> 00:54:09,016
- Don't touch me, please.
- Sorry? Why?

825
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:11,852
- Moving toward Park Seong-jun.
- What is that on your face?

826
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:13,854
What's wrong with my face?

827
00:54:15,189 --> 00:54:16,523
Ki-baek.

828
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:19,401
I don't even see a trail here.
Can we keep going like this?

829
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:22,905
I really hate stuff like this. I'm scared.

830
00:54:22,905 --> 00:54:25,115
Ki-baek, let's stop here.

831
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,576
Come on, Ki-baek.

832
00:54:28,118 --> 00:54:29,453
Let's head back down, okay?

833
00:54:30,621 --> 00:54:34,291
They said we'd get there in half an hour,
so let's just find the shed.

834
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:36,377
We need the hint, you know.

835
00:54:36,377 --> 00:54:39,964
I'm right here, so don't worry.

836
00:54:41,507 --> 00:54:44,885
Your face is scaring
the crap out of me right now.

837
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:46,845
We can do this, okay?

838
00:54:46,845 --> 00:54:50,599
So let's just get that hint
and head back down. All right?

839
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:51,976
Man, this is nuts.

840
00:54:57,147 --> 00:54:58,440
- Wait up.
- All right.

841
00:55:05,364 --> 00:55:06,657
I'm scared.

842
00:55:06,657 --> 00:55:09,910
We're okay. We'll be all right.

843
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:23,924
What?

844
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:24,883
What is it?

845
00:55:25,592 --> 00:55:26,927
Ki-baek!

846
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:29,805
Ki-baek!

847
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,487
He fell and rolled off the trail? Where?

848
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:49,533
Well, we just followed the red rope, but...

849
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,368
Hey, call the police.

850
00:55:51,368 --> 00:55:53,162
No, call 911 first.

851
00:55:53,162 --> 00:55:56,999
No, no. Check the memory card
from Yu-yeong's camera first.

852
00:55:57,499 --> 00:55:58,792
Hey, Woo-ju.

853
00:55:59,877 --> 00:56:01,378
Woo-ju! Where are you going?

854
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:06,383
Mr. Song!

855
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,219
Mr. Song!

856
00:56:11,096 --> 00:56:12,723
Mr. Song!

857
00:56:14,266 --> 00:56:15,517
Where is he?

858
00:56:16,894 --> 00:56:18,437
Mr. Song!

859
00:56:24,693 --> 00:56:29,281
Mr. Song! Where are you? Mr. Song!

860
00:56:30,365 --> 00:56:32,659
Hi. We're by the parking lot
at Mount Seongak.

861
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:35,370
- I couldn't find him.
- We searched but couldn't find him.

862
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,581
- A member is injured...
- This is nuts.

863
00:56:37,581 --> 00:56:40,375
The guy who went missing in the woods.
Is it my brother?

864
00:56:42,377 --> 00:56:43,378
I'm sorry.

865
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:45,297
Don't worry.

866
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:49,551
He won't die like this.
It's too embarrassing for him.

867
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:04,608
Director Chae.

868
00:57:05,192 --> 00:57:06,193
Yes.

869
00:57:07,444 --> 00:57:09,279
Why didn't you prepare thoroughly?

870
00:57:09,988 --> 00:57:11,323
I'm sorry,

871
00:57:12,074 --> 00:57:18,747
but we ran multiple simulations,
and I came here several times myself.

872
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:25,546
A cast member
has gone missing in the woods,

873
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:28,340
and the head writer went
into the woods without a plan.

874
00:57:28,966 --> 00:57:31,135
Director Chae, aren't you in charge here?

875
00:57:31,718 --> 00:57:32,719
I'm sorry.

876
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:35,097
- I have nothing to say.
- So, Ms. On--

877
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:40,185
Go and find them both, right now.

878
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:44,523
Or I'll blow up this damn show.

879
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:52,072
Ki-baek. Where are you?

880
00:57:52,698 --> 00:57:53,699
Where--

881
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,454
Ki-baek! Mr. Song Ki-baek, where are you?

882
00:58:04,543 --> 00:58:06,503
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

883
00:58:12,885 --> 00:58:13,886
A shoe?

884
00:58:49,755 --> 00:58:53,133
I just twisted it slightly. I'll be fine.

885
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:54,426
I'll just sleep it off.

886
00:58:57,888 --> 00:58:58,722
I...

887
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:02,226
That hurt.

888
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:04,228
Oh, hey. I'm sorry.

889
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:09,650
Well...

890
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:22,704
Did we have a fight?

891
00:59:23,497 --> 00:59:24,331
Nope.

892
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:28,627
But you won't even look at me.
And what about what you said earlier?

893
00:59:30,254 --> 00:59:33,257
You've been acting strange
since yesterday. What's going on?

894
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:35,968
Don't you regret your decision?

895
00:59:45,936 --> 00:59:50,941
Am I performing well enough
according to your plan?

896
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,862
You said I should do something,
and when you asked me

897
00:59:56,697 --> 00:59:58,991
if I wanted to do it,
my heart skipped a beat.

898
01:00:01,118 --> 01:00:02,995
Because everyone said it was all over,

899
01:00:02,995 --> 01:00:05,205
but you said I should start afresh.

900
01:00:12,504 --> 01:00:14,172
But who knew that new beginning--

901
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,384
meant that I had to let someone
use me as her tool?

902
01:00:18,635 --> 01:00:20,095
What are you talking about?

903
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,014
When did I use you as a tool?

904
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:23,890
It was because of Kim Jeong-heon.

905
01:00:25,183 --> 01:00:27,603
Everyone's a pro in this game,

906
01:00:27,603 --> 01:00:30,272
so you needed an amateur
who could provoke Kim Jeong-heon

907
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:32,149
in an unpredictable manner.

908
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:35,902
And that's me, Song Ki-baek.

909
01:00:38,113 --> 01:00:41,533
Look, I think there's been
a serious misunderstanding.

910
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:42,743
You know, I'm hurt.

911
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:47,247
I mean, I get it.

912
01:00:48,206 --> 01:00:50,250
But you, Ms. On, you really hurt me.

913
01:00:52,252 --> 01:00:53,253
But you know what?

914
01:00:54,087 --> 01:00:56,381
I can't quite figure out why I'm hurt.

915
01:00:58,884 --> 01:01:01,762
What was the potential you saw in me?

916
01:01:02,846 --> 01:01:04,348
What was it that you saw in me?

917
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:16,068
My heart fluttered.

918
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:23,033
And right now...

919
01:01:26,078 --> 01:01:27,746
my heart is fluttering.

920
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:15,585
FRANKLY SPEAKING

921
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:19,464
{\an8}<i>Sorry. I've never once thought
it could be true love.</i>

922
01:02:19,464 --> 01:02:23,301
{\an8}Please welcome the new member.

923
01:02:23,301 --> 01:02:25,429
{\an8}<i>The new girl is really something.</i>

924
01:02:25,429 --> 01:02:29,349
{\an8}Is there someone you like here?

925
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:32,477
{\an8}Are you all right? If you're having
a hard time, talk to someone.

926
01:02:32,477 --> 01:02:33,687
{\an8}You can talk to me too.

927
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:36,690
{\an8}I like her even more now. Way more.

928
01:02:37,357 --> 01:02:41,403
{\an8}<i>-Just say it. Don't keep it bottled up.</i>
- I'm hurt, okay? I'm upset.

929
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,781
There's something I want to do.

930
01:02:44,781 --> 01:02:46,867
Woo-ju, we've got a really big problem.

931
01:02:50,495 --> 01:02:55,500
