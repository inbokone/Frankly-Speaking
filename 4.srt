<i>That is the reason
I must be a man who cannot lie,</i>

6
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:23,907

9
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:43,969
What a load of crap.
You quit your job on an impulse?

10
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:44,887
Are you nuts?

11
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,722
Do you have enough money to survive?

12
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:49,224
<i>Still, wasn't it pretty cool what I did?</i>

13
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:51,101
<i>I protected my dream--</i>

14
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,480
Two million won a month goes to family.

15
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,025
And 1.5 million to cover
your loan and the interest.

16
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:59,693
Oh, your severance pay?

17
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:02,654
You used it to help out your family
with their security deposit.

18
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:03,864
What a good son.

19
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:06,784
Credit card bills,
transportation expenses, phone bill.

20
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:08,494
SEIZED ASSET, BALANCE 0 WON

21
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:13,082
You're broke. You'll starve to death
trying to protect your dream.

22
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,840
<i>Perhaps, this is a new opportunity for me.</i>

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,759
Opportunity, my ass.

24
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,345
You turned off the switch on your life
with your own hands.

25
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:28,639
Wouldn't you say?

Yeah, I'm still here.

EPISODE 4: THE SWITCH

33
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:56,226
Please enjoy.

34
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:58,103
- Thank you.
- Sure.

35
00:03:58,812 --> 00:03:59,980
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

36
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,191
- Jeong-hun, it's been a while.
- Hello.

37
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:06,195
The chief seems busy this morning.

38
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:21,168
Anyway, Woo-ju doesn't need to know
about this, right?

39
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:22,753
Of course not.

40
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:27,674
No head writer would be happy to learn
that a junior writer makes more money.

41
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:30,385
You know I have faith in you, don't you?

42
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:32,679
That's why I agreed to pay
what you asked for.

43
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:36,600
I make sure my work is worth my pay,
so don't worry.

44
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,727
Do you want me to meet
with Kim Jeong-heon?

45
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,312
I know everyone at Forever C&C.

46
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,147
Oh, will you?

47
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:47,194
Woo-ju seems to be going through
a rough patch lately.

48
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:48,111
Come on.

49
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:51,073
That's no excuse for a writer.
When the tide comes in,

50
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:55,452
you've got to paddle, even if it means
using chopsticks when your paddles break.

51
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:58,580
That's my Ha-young.

52
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,253
Who cares how much she makes?

53
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:06,004
There's no point in getting jealous.

54
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:09,341
It's okay, On Woo-ju.
Just focus on your own work.

55
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,219
Wow, Ha-young is so amazing.

56
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:14,096
She got all these sponsors for our show

57
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,348
even before the casting was completed.

58
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:17,432
She's really great.

59
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:22,521
Woo-ju is hardworking too,
but I have to say, she's not as efficient.

60
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,605
- Right?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah. Do you want some of this?

62
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,775
I can't eat right now.

63
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:33,657
- Ms. On, it's been a while.
- Yes? Oh, hello.

64
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,451
- Hey, Woo-ju.
- Yes?

65
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:37,744
- Starting a new show?
- Yes.

66
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:39,788
- I hope it goes well.
- Wish me luck!

67
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,624
- Ms. On.
- Yes?

68
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:44,084
- Let's grab a bite sometime.
- Sure.

69
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:45,669
- I'll call you.
- I'll call you.

70
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:51,091
- Ms. On Woo-ju.
- Yes?

71
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,011
I have a shoot here at the set.

72
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,767
<i>That's no excuse for a writer.

74
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:08,734
Hey, we're late.

75
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,068
- Let's go.
- See you there.

76
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,911
Hey, On Woo-ju.
You're going to make the floor collapse.

77
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,290
Even when I start my morning feeling good,
it doesn't even last half a day.

I cannot lie.

Truth, fairness and justice.

81
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:35,177
I trust that news programs devoid
of these values aren't worth existing.

84
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,378
On Woo-ju, what are you doing?

85
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,194
Oh, my God!

86
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:37,531
Mr. Song?

87
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:39,825
Ms. On, what are you...

88
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,910
Are you actually following me around? Why?

89
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,954
What are you doing here?

90
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,372
- I live here.
- I live here.

91
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:46,623
- What?
- What?

92
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,545
They're fixing up their storage room
for their eldest son who's moving in.

93
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,088
They apologized for the noise.

94
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:57,092
Apparently, their son also works
at a TV station.

95
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:58,009
He's an announcer.

96
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,012
The eldest son who just moved in upstairs?

97
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:03,014
- The announcer?
- Listen, dear.

98
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:06,101
The landlady's daughter
is a TV show writer.

99
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:08,645
Should I ask her to cast you on her show?

100
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:11,148
You're the landlady's daughter?

101
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:12,149
Yeah.

102
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,528
What happened to your apartment?

103
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,280
That huge, fancy apartment.

104
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,781
It's not my apartment.

105
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:22,159
It belongs to a friend
who's been working abroad.

106
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,411
He moved back
out of the blue and kicked me out.

107
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:27,456
My attempt to build a nice image
and reputation

108
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:30,000
with something that wasn't even mine
ended in failure.

109
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:32,002
I see.

110
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:35,464
Can you stop asking questions?
I don't want to answer.

111
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,965
You know I can't help it.

112
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,135
It's not like I wanted to hear
all those details.

113
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:51,271
I'll go. This is your house, your rooftop.

114
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,609
The rooftop is a shared space.

115
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:57,486
You can stay.

116
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:14,628
Are you okay?

117
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:18,465
I've never seen anyone
make such a dramatic exit from their job.

118
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:20,717
I'm not okay.

119
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:23,512
Right. Of course not.

120
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:25,889
So what's your plan now?

121
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:27,641
I don't know.

122
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,893
- Anything you want to do?
- No.

123
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,063
Do you regret it?

124
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:35,774
Yes.

125
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:38,527
No plans, no hope.

126
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,487
What a great combination.

127
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,865
You didn't have to point it out like that.

128
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:48,161
You looked like
you could use a reality check.

129
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:54,626
I have no plans or things
that I want to do, and I do regret it.

130
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,006
But even if I could go back,
I think I'd make the same decision.

131
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:03,843
It was cool.

132
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,974
It was cool how you left.
I've never seen anything like it.

133
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:24,155
Oh, I meant to throw it away,
but I couldn't find a trash can.

134
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,284
Got some pastries?

135
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,244
Are you throwing them away?
Can I have some?

136
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:31,413
Well...

137
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:33,373
Yeah.

138
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,129
It's good.

139
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,467
It may be all squashed out of shape,
but it's retained its taste and flavor,

140
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:49,306
which means it's still pastry, not trash.

141
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,643
You do have a way with words.

142
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:02,986
Would you like to drink one of these?

143
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,291
I won't ask you if you're okay.

144
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:23,506
You tell me when you're not okay,
and I'll buy you some pastries then.

145
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,305
It's good.

146

Mom, are you going somewhere?

151
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,769
I have a grade school reunion.

152
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,396
I've told you about it many times.

153
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:21,856
Do you have my pictures with you?

154
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:23,900
What are you going to do if you miss me?

155
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,318
You crazy girl.

156
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:28,029
I've got tons. You took a lot of them.

157
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,325
Goodness, you're a fool for your daughter,
my dear Ms. Bok-ja.

158
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,536
Don't be gross, silly.

00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:39,958
- I can take care of myself.
- It's not for you.

161
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,709
It's for Gu-won if he comes over.

162
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:45,130
You don't need to tell me
how to take care of him. God.

163
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:47,549
By the way,

164
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:53,054
isn't the storage room upstairs
too small for a grown man?

165
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,931
If he can lie in it, isn't it good enough?

166
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:57,142
Why?

167
00:12:57,142 --> 00:13:02,313
Would you be willing
to let him stay in your room?

168
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:04,941
What? Don't be ridiculous.

169
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:07,068
Ms. Bok-ja is leaving.

170
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,029
- How is it?
- Not bad.

171
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,656
That's what I thought.

172
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:25,545
This should...

173
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:33,928
{\an8}CHINESE CRASH COURSE
FOR BEGINNERS

174
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,972
{\an8}SONG KI-BAEK

175
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,523
Wow, I didn't know I still had this.

176
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,702
Man, this is going to take forever.

177
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:05,293
Song Un-baek. I said, come move this.

178
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:07,462
And Pung-baek, go help your dad.

179
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:10,048
Come on, Mom.
You told me to clean the bathroom.

180
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,717
What am I, a spider?
You think I have ten hands?

181
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,220
Spiders don't have ten hands, dummy.

182
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,846
- They have six.
- Oh, zip it.

183
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:17,764
Just do it.

184
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:20,517
Ki-baek is in his room. Have him do it.

185
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,187
He needs to rest.
He hasn't been home in a long time.

186
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,064
Stop yapping and just get to it.

187
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,950
There are only a few of us here,

188
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,953
but someone gets to rest
while the others have to work.

189
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:41,996
We were going to help you clean up.

190
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,373
Finished unpacking already?

191
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:47,335
No, there isn't enough space,
so I'll just get to it later.

192
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:50,171
And I could move out again
if things get better.

193
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,885
Why unpack at all
if you're moving back out?

194
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:59,639
Do what you want, Ki-baek.

195
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,267
There's food in the fridge,
so make sure you eat.

196
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,936
If you run out of toilet paper
or towels in the bathroom,

197
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,980
they're in the storage room...

198
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,024
They're in your room, in the closet.

199
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,863
- Let me carry it downstairs for you.
- No, you don't have to.

200
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:17,532
- It's just these boxes.
- Have lunch with your brother.

201
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:18,616
See you later, Mom.

202
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:20,660
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.

203
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,704
Un-baek.

204
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:26,124
Spiders don't have six hands.
They have eight legs.

205
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:29,127
See you, Dad.

206
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,546
Come home early.

207
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:32,547
See you.

208
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:36,718
- Six, you say?
- Give it a rest.

209
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:43,683
Man, it's so hot.

210
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,279
Whoa.

211
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:04,162
Who's hungry? I'm making ramyeon.

212
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:05,538
I have to go to the gym.

213
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:08,124
If I don't fix the toilet,
we can't open tomorrow.

214
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:10,293
Me. I'll have some.

215
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,337
What?

216
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:17,008
You can eat with him.

217
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:24,599
Please stay. Come on, please?

218
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,684
- For God's sake.
- It's going to be so awkward.

219
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:27,769
Ta-da!

220
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:30,146
Let's eat.

221
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,190
- It looks good.
- Right?

222
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:49,499
Hey, are you really planning
on staying here?

223
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:52,418
Why? You don't want me here?

224
00:16:52,418 --> 00:16:53,628
It's uncomfortable.

225
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:57,465
I'm not comfortable here either.

226
00:16:58,174 --> 00:16:59,592
Now that I'm here,

227
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:02,720
I'm constantly being confronted
with how crappy my life is.

228
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:12,563
I just don't have
any other choice right now.

229
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:18,653
Is that who we are?
People who make your life crappy?

230
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,364
This ramyeon is so good.

231
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:23,324
Isn't it good? Help yourself.

232
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:24,242
Hey, slow down.

233
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:29,330
Man, it's awesome.
I cooked it really well this time.

234
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:42,051
<i>You've got to paddle, even if it means
using chopsticks when your paddles break.</i>

235
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:52,979
No, thanks.
Hyeong-taek, what are we having for lunch?

236
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:54,397
Hamburgers.

237
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:01,320
Good God.

238
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,739
Care to join me for coffee?

239
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:13,833
You sure you're okay with this?

240
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:19,839
Of course. I got Kim Jeong-heon,
everyone's ideal son-in-law, on my show

241
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,466
without making any effort.

242
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,968
- I should thank you.
- It's good to be appreciated.

243
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,097
Now that we've got the main cast member,

244
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:30,600
things will move fast
with production and programming.

245
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,311
I'll sort out the details as well.

246
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:38,191
How have you been?

247
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,819
We haven't seen each other in eight years.

248
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:47,742
We dated and broke up
in the most ordinary and typical way.

249
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:48,993
That's all.

250
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,830
We're Jeong-heon and Woo-ju.
It couldn't have been ordinary or typical.

251
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:54,665
That's so hurtful.

252
00:18:58,002 --> 00:18:59,754
I'm here to work.

253
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:02,715
You should do the same.
Stop joking around.

254
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,135
Well, you said you liked that I'm funny.

255
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:08,262
That's not your personality.

256
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:09,972
It's your well-crafted armor.

257
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:13,601
You're just trying to hide the fact
that you're only interested in yourself.

258
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,522
Woo-ju.

259
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:20,149
When I lied to you before--

260
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:25,154
Say one more word, and I'll destroy you.
I don't care who you think you are.

261
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:32,995
All right, well, let's take it slow.

262
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,375
I'm just happy
that we sat across each other today.

263
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,460
I look forward
to working with you, Ms. On.

264
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:51,472
Getting a job at another company...

265
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:53,349
I wouldn't be able to keep my mouth shut.

266
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:55,726
I can't get anyone else in trouble. Pass.

267
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:57,478
Emceeing events?

268
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,439
Right, who knows
what I might jabber about again?

269
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:02,191
Yeah, pass.

270
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:04,902
Teaching aspiring announcers?

271
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:09,365
I'd better not shatter
their hopes and dreams.

272
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:14,996
A reporter. That won't work either
if I can't stick to the script.

273
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:18,291
I should look for a remote job.

274
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,796
Man, what an incompetent
experienced worker I am.

275
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,347
Hey, you don't want to do anything,
but you wish you could do something?

276
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,975
Wow, that's hard to understand.

277
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:37,310
What does that mean?

278
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:41,272
Oh, did I say all that out loud again?

279
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,152
How come you're always alone?

280
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,404
Like at the bathhouse before,
and now here too.

281
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,325
I see.

282
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:55,786
Hey, are you good at riding a bike?

283
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:57,246
Can you teach me?

284
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:59,624
I can't be bothered.
Ask your dad to teach you.

285
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:00,917
I don't have a dad.

286
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,794
And my mom is busy.

287
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:08,341
My mom works at a TV station,
and she's really busy.

288
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:11,886
Grandma always says it's too dangerous.

289
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:14,680
I also taught myself how to ride a bike.

290
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,641
You're supposed to do it alone.

291
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:19,101
Look, see?
It only has one seat, doesn't it?

292
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:22,647
Okay, I'll do it alone.

293
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,690
Goodbye.

294
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:35,993
Riding a bike is so much fun!

295
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,079
Hey, you can let go now.

296
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,163
No, you'll fall.

297
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:40,373
Just let go!

298
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:42,917
- You'll hurt yourself if you fall.
- Just let go!

299
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:50,216
See? I told you you'd fall.

300
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:53,386
So? I can just get back up.

301
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,098
You're a total wimp.

302
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,732
I got it!

303
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:16,701
YOON JI-HU

304
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:19,453
Hey, what's up?

305
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:23,249
I'm not doing anything.
Just standing in the street.

306
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:24,500
Why?

307
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,836
I knew you had it in you, Woo-ju.

308
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:30,339
How did you get
Kim Jeong-heon just like that?

309
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:33,509
I-na, are you ready to move to
a bigger place that has more light,

310
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:37,555
is far away from the bathroom,
and doesn't smell like smoke?

311
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:39,390
Hey!

312
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,766
Hey, On Woo-ju!

313
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:43,811
Hey! You two, get out.

314
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:45,521
What?

315
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:48,691
- Beom, what are you--
- I need to talk to Woo-ju, so get out.

316
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:50,568
Is that not clear?

317
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:51,777
You can stay.

318
00:22:53,863 --> 00:22:56,198
- What?
- I don't know what this is about.

319
00:22:56,198 --> 00:22:59,118
But Min-gu and I-na are
also writers on my team.

320
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,997
Look, what's your deal
with Kim Jeong-heon?

321
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:03,914
Sorry?

322
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:07,293
Who does he think he is
to turn me down and treat me like crap?

323
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,005
Is he looking to get back at me
for refusing to cast him before?

324
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:13,299
- That's...
- You know what?

325
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,176
Maybe I should talk to Lee Ha-young.

326
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:17,053
I hear she's the actual head writer.

327
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:18,679
She even makes more money than you.

328
00:23:23,976 --> 00:23:27,146
Yes, that's right. Do you need her number?

329
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:29,774
But I doubt talking to her
will make any difference.

330
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:32,568
Hey, have you lost your mind?

331
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:33,944
- Hey!
- Woof, woof!

332
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:36,238
Woof... What?

333
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:39,533
You sounded like a barking dog
with your bullshit, so I tried it too.

334
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,285
Bullshit?

335
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:43,162
You must be out of your mind.

336
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:44,830
- Are you insane?
- Beom.

337
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:52,129
I was wondering where you went
in the middle of the shoot.

338
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,506
Here you are.

339
00:23:58,344 --> 00:24:00,387
Come on, what is this?

340
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:03,349
This is embarrassing for someone
who has it all like you.

341
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:04,767
Look, Jeong-heon.

342
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:06,894
You think you're some superstar?

343
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,106
How long do you think you'll last?

344
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:11,941
I don't know.

345
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:16,695
But probably longer than you.

346
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:20,116
Because I'm younger.

347
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:26,622
Man, you little...

348
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:34,130
What is going on here?

349
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,884
Beom came to talk to Woo-ju
about casting, and...

350
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:42,763
Let's go.
I invited you all to lunch today.

351
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:44,765
Count me out. I'm busy.

352
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:49,436
Come on, let's go.

353
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:52,356
We'll be working together,
and this will bring the team closer.

354
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:54,400
No, you guys go. I have tons to do.

355
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,277
- Oh, come on.
- I said no.

356
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:58,445
- You have to eat. Let's go.
- I'm not hungry.

357
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:00,197
My goodness.

358
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:01,907
Thank you, it was great.

359
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,578
The ideal son-in-law is here.

360
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:08,747
Although I couldn't cook you a chicken,
I picked the biggest,

361
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:12,710
juiciest octopuses
and cooked them up nice and spicy.

362
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,920
Right. Thank you, Mother.

363
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,881
Oh, my goodness!

364
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,757
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

365
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:20,384
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

366
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,138
Wow, this will hit the spot.
It's going to be our stress-buster.

367
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:25,681
Do you like spicy food?

368
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:27,975
It looks delicious.

369
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:29,852
I-na and Min-gu aren't joining us?

370
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:32,062
I gave them my credit card.
They'll be happier alone.

371
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:35,482
- Isn't it good?
- Wow, it's really hot.

372
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:38,235
<i>Are you okay?</i>

373
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:44,450
I told you we should have ox bone soup.
You can't even look at spicy food.

374
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,204
You said you were in a bad mood.
You could use some spice.

375
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:07,723
Moving forward,

376
00:26:07,723 --> 00:26:11,101
I'd prefer if you let the production crew
handle the casting decisions.

377
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:15,522
It's true that having you on our show
is a great help,

378
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:19,026
but we're not your puppets.

379
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:24,990
Is that something you should bring up
in the middle of the meal?

380
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,825
Why not?

381
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:29,078
It's fine to talk about
things like this anytime,

382
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:30,246
you know, between us.

383
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:32,122
Yeah.

384
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,508
SWEET JEONG-HONEY SOJU

385
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,896
You're good at your job.

386
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:59,817
What are you getting at?

387
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:02,736
Nothing. It's about the way
you handled things earlier.

388
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:08,200
And I don't know how you did it,
but you snapped up Jeong-heon right away,

389
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,327
and he even knows
what kind of food you like.

390
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:15,082
I thought you might have some
special skills to win someone's heart.

391
00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:17,835
Lee Ha-young, you're crossing a line here.

392
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:20,546
Come on, don't take it so seriously.

393
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:23,090
It's a compliment.
I'm saying I'm impressed.

394
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:30,597
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

395
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:33,142
THE 8TH HEALTHY HUNDRED FESTIVAL
MC KIM HYEOK-JIN

396
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:34,435
<i>Yah, ah, ah, ah</i>

397
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:36,937
<i>That's why I dream every day</i>

398
00:27:36,937 --> 00:27:40,858
I thought we were here to see Hyeok-jin.
He's a news anchor, so why are we here?

399
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:41,775
What?

400
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,403
Well.

401
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:46,655
- Hey, you want to grab a seat?
- All right.

402
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:51,160
Wow, that was so adorable.

403
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,288
Watch your step. Wow, all right.

404
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:57,499
So, did you guys enjoy
our little ones' show?

405
00:27:57,499 --> 00:27:58,584
- Yes!
- Yes!

406
00:27:58,584 --> 00:28:00,419
- Let's give them a hand!
- Hyeok-jin?

407
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:05,507
Ma'am, you look like
you're having a blast.

408
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:08,010
You'll hurt your knees.
Take it easy, all right?

409
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,889
Sit back and let your dear boy Hyeok-jin
entertain you, okay?

410
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:15,184
{\an8}I'm Kim Hyeok-jin.
Thank you for watching <i>JBC News at Noon</i>.

411
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,227
Thank you.

412
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:22,733
That's a wrap.
That was Mr. Kim Hyeok-jin's final show.

413
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:26,403
- Great work!
- Great job!

414
00:28:27,196 --> 00:28:28,489
You've done amazing work.

415
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,615
Great work.

416
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:33,118
You'll be doing nothing but news shows
over there at ITN, Mr. Anchorman.

417
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:35,496
Let's all have a meal sometime.

418
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,414
- I'd love that.
- Of course. Thank you.

419
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:38,582
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

420
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:39,875
Sure.

421
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,668
Great work, Hyeok-jin.

422
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:46,840
When I'm gone,
you should take over this show, Ki-baek.

423
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,426
I want to do nothing but news shows
just like you.

424
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:51,011
I'm a fan of yours.

425
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:55,599
I'm sure you'll do a better job.

426
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:03,232
I talked to him a few days ago.

427
00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:05,776
When I told him you quit,
he said he wanted to see you.

428
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:08,737
You know how much he cared about you.
He's just been busy.

429
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:11,490
Who is that guy?

430
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,202
I'd rather see the trot singer boy again.

431
00:29:15,202 --> 00:29:20,666
I saw somewhere earlier that
he's a "fring" announcer or something.

432
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,376
"Fufuring"?

433
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:24,086
"Fufurang"?

434
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:25,421
A freelance announcer.

435
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:29,216
Hyeok-jin!

436
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:36,682
<i>You're my adorable honey bunny</i>

437
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:38,183
- Looks great.
- Good to see you.

438
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:39,268
You too.

439
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:41,770
So, are you enjoying your freelance life?

440
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:45,232
You host some events like this

441
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:47,276
and some TV shows, right?

442
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:50,863
God, this is good.
Hey, are you kidding me?

443
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:53,282
Anyone with a mouth
can be a show host now.

444
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:54,950
I feel like just another worker ant.

445
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,744
To survive winter when jobs are scarce,

446
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:59,496
I have to kiss my dignity goodbye
the rest of the year.

447
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:02,666
I've seen lots of people hit it big
after going freelance.

448
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:06,128
You'd better start that story
with "Once upon a time."

449
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:08,422
Things aren't like how they used to be.

450
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:11,508
Freelancing sounds glamorous,
but we're all hustling to get by.

451
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:14,094
The competition out here
is on a whole other level.

452
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:17,723
Actors, comedians, models, sports stars.

453
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:20,434
I constantly get knocked around
competing with those guys.

454
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:22,269
So why do you live like this?

455
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:26,064
I'm sorry?

456
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:29,485
What's with Ki-baek today?

457
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:32,571
Get it together.

458
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:34,782
I heard you quit your job.

459
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:40,454
Throw your shoulders back and keep
your voice at... do, re, mi, fa, sol, sol.

460
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:42,623
Hello.

461
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:44,291
Keep it higher than that, okay?

462
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,418
It's not easy to survive in this field.

463
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:49,296
Take a photo with me.

464
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:52,758
- Goodness. Sure thing.
- All right.

465
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:54,885
So, do you remember my name?

466
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:56,303
Just take it.

467
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:58,931
I'm going to show it to my grandson.

468
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:03,477
- You're quite the wordsmith.
- Goodness, thank you so much.

469
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:06,355
Hey, look. You should tell that to them.

470
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:08,065
- See that tent?
- Yeah.

471
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:10,859
You'll find Chief Kim
from the district office there.

472
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:13,445
Go tell him to hire me again next time.

473
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:15,364
- All right.
- Promise?

474
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:17,282
- Yes.
- All right, good.

475
00:31:17,282 --> 00:31:18,992
- Look over here.
- Yeah.

476
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:20,327
All right.

477
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:22,454
- Take care then.
- All right.

478
00:31:22,454 --> 00:31:23,622
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

479
00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:26,083
- I'm going to show this to my grandson.
- All right.

480
00:31:30,712 --> 00:31:31,672
Let's see.

481
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:37,469
Here.

482
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:39,096
What is this?

483
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:40,097
Pocket money.

484
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:44,268
I don't want this.

485
00:31:47,062 --> 00:31:48,856
Come on, man.

486
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:51,483
Look, I know how it is. I've been there.

487
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:54,945
Here. Take it.

488
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:56,655
All right.

489
00:31:57,364 --> 00:32:00,200
People say this sells
like hot cakes at the market.

490
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:03,745
Take it. It's a gift for my longtime fan.

491
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,045
I'm not your fan anymore.

492
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:13,881
What's that?

493
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,717
What's wrong with him today?

494
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:16,985
We see each other often
now that we're in the same neighborhood.

495
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:20,364
We live under the same roof, to be exact.

496
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:34,962
That was a close call.

497
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,005
All right. You can let go now.

498
00:34:30,892 --> 00:34:35,188
Was it like witnessing the downfall
of a man who used to be your role model?

499
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,483
I thought it was
something like that until...

500
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:42,696
- Until?
- Until I saw the look on his face.

501
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:46,324
<i>He didn't look like
someone who had fallen.</i>

502
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:52,164
Should he be moping around just because
he's not on the news anymore?

503
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:54,332
Every morning, you wake up to a new day.

504
00:34:54,332 --> 00:34:56,877
Who knows what life's got up its sleeve?

505
00:34:57,502 --> 00:34:59,171
Don't be a wimp.

506
00:35:07,095 --> 00:35:11,058
I keep hoping for a new day to come,
but it never seems to happen.

507
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:14,561
- Can I tell you a cliché?
- Wait.

508
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:18,148
If it's about darkness before sunrise,
I appreciate the gesture, but I'll pass.

509
00:35:18,148 --> 00:35:20,358
I wasn't going to make any gestures.

510
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:23,945
When you're feeling down
and have a lot on your mind,

511
00:35:23,945 --> 00:35:26,114
it helps to get some spicy food.

512
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:29,326
When life throws too much spice at you,
don't back down.

513
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:31,286
You should be

514
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:32,454
just as spicy.

515
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:37,793
It's like,
"Cheer yourself up when things get hard."

516
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:42,297
I'm sharing my first meal of the day
with you, so enjoy.

517
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:50,472
This is your first meal today?

518
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,391
I've been busy.

519
00:35:54,476 --> 00:36:00,023
Before I quit my job, when I didn't feel
like eating and had no energy to,

520
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:03,235
my go-to excuse was that I was too busy.

521
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:07,447
Were you busy today?

522
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:33,932
"Let's keep going. Just do something."

523
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:36,560
"Give it a try,
and if it doesn't work, try again."

524
00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:39,479
I keep telling myself that, but...

525
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:44,901
These days, I'm busy getting humiliated
every second of the day.

526
00:36:49,698 --> 00:36:51,366
Spicy food, huh?

527
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:55,912
Damn it.

528
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:56,997
Oh, no.

529
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:59,708
Come on, not on a white T-shirt.

530
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:00,709
Hang on.

531
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:05,547
Oh, that's-- I'll do it.

532
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:07,674
I'll do it.

533
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:13,096
Huh? No, I'll...

534
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:22,647
I'll do it.

535
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:29,362
Get it out quickly.

536
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,995
Is this yours, Ki-baek?

537
00:37:36,995 --> 00:37:38,997
Did I drop this too?

538
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:41,666
Jesus.

539
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:46,755
Damn.

540
00:37:47,756 --> 00:37:51,009
I haven't seen someone
with a notebook in a long time.

541
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:53,762
I used to carry around
an idea notebook too.

542
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:56,640
Oh, I found it
when I was unpacking my stuff today.

543
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,016
I didn't even know I had it.

544
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:06,191
You can have it.

545
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:08,652
- What?
- Scratch that. You can borrow it.

546
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,781
- Wait, why are you--
- Just because.

547
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:15,533
When life seemed boring, predictable
and pathetic,

548
00:38:16,284 --> 00:38:17,661
I used to read that.

549
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:20,622
You can borrow it.

550
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:48,024
<i>Ki-baek.</i>

551
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:51,778
You feel completely lost,
like you don't know what to do next

552
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:54,614
or even who the hell you are, right?

553
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:58,201
<i>But Ki-baek.</i>

554
00:39:00,078 --> 00:39:01,121
You'll do a better job.

555
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:03,248
I'm sure you'll do a better job.

556
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:26,229
Hello!

557
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,148
Hello!

558
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:30,608
Hi, how are you?

559
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:33,945
I brought you some snacks.

560
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:37,782
What's he doing here again?

561
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:38,950
Goodness gracious.

562
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,869
- Oh, what the heck?
- This place here.

563
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:43,496
Isn't it the most beautiful island
in the country?

564
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:46,124
I know it, you know it,

565
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:47,959
everybody in the world knows it.

566
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:51,755
So please let me do this, okay?

567
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:54,674
I don't care if it's for TV.
No cameras. Leave us alone.

568
00:39:54,674 --> 00:40:00,597
Boy, you're so impatient.
Just hold on a sec and hear me out.

569
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:11,066
In that case, I'd be open to negotiating.

570
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:14,527
I'll draw up
the location rental fees on paper.

571
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:17,280
Oh, we want a new heating system
at the village hall.

572
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,615
Can you make it happen?

573
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:21,576
One of our potential sponsors
is a heating manufacturer.

574
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:22,911
We'll make it happen.

575
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:26,873
Goodness gracious.

576
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:29,667
You wore me down, missy.

577
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:33,380
While you're here, feel free to pick
all the chilies from this row.

578
00:40:34,923 --> 00:40:36,883
- Min-gu.
- Yeah?

579
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:38,051
Hey, get it ready.

580
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:40,095
Come have some snacks.

581
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:44,182
Hi, Mom.

582
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:45,266
<i>You mean girl.</i>

583
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:47,894
Your mom stays out overnight
for the first time in decades,

584
00:40:47,894 --> 00:40:49,437
and you didn't even call?

585
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:54,484
I was just about to call you.
It's like we can read each other's minds--

586
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:56,194
Forget it, silly.

587
00:40:56,194 --> 00:41:00,740
Get yourself home early.
Don't stay out late drinking, okay?

588
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,492
<i>Drinking? No, I'm working.</i>

589
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:04,577
I'm not worried about you.

590
00:41:04,577 --> 00:41:07,080
You might put
other people in danger, dear.

591
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:09,874
What?

592
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,597
MY DAUGHTER

593
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:28,143
<i>Hello? Mom? Mom.</i>

594
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:29,227
Mom.

595
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:47,245
I'm fine.
You know it's bothered me for years.

596
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:49,205
It'll be okay if I rest for a bit.

597
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:51,458
That's the problem. That it's been years.

598
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:55,920
Until this day, just seeing a motorcycle
pass by gives me a sinking feeling.

599
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,922
It doesn't hurt anymore.

600
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:02,135
You're supposed to be the breadwinner,
but now I handle everything.

601
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:03,344
Hope you're happy.

602
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:09,100
How come my life never gets any easier?

603
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:14,856
From this month, Ki-baek won't be able
to give us any money.

604
00:42:16,983 --> 00:42:23,198
Oh, hey. Your brothers went
to hand out flyers for Un-baek's gym.

605
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:25,825
You should eat.
I made some nice kimchi soup.

606
00:42:25,825 --> 00:42:27,452
Go on and eat.

607
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:34,083
By the way, why is it cold in here?

608
00:42:39,214 --> 00:42:40,340
No.

609
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,509
Eighteen degrees?

610
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:45,803
Stop!

611
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:47,972
Who was it? Who did this?

612
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:54,145
Didn't we agree to keep the utility bills
under 50,000 won each month

613
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:57,232
as a show of cooperation, sacrifice,
and love for each other?

614
00:42:57,232 --> 00:43:00,109
It's gotten really hot lately though.

615
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:01,402
Okay, then.

616
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:04,072
- Was it you?
- No!

617
00:43:04,072 --> 00:43:05,573
Son.

618
00:43:08,243 --> 00:43:09,577
Was it you?

619
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:12,830
No!

620
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,208
Oh, it wasn't me.

621
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,252
It really wasn't me.

622
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:19,546
And Mom, I'm not hungry.

623
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:30,974
I can lie again now? Why?

624
00:43:32,058 --> 00:43:35,311
When did the switch turn off?

625
00:43:47,365 --> 00:43:48,616
<i>On Woo-ju.</i>

626
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:51,411
What is she?

627
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:09,470
Hello? This is Song Ki-baek.

628
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:13,057
Oh, Yoon Ji-hu recommended me?

629
00:44:13,057 --> 00:44:16,269
Oh, sure. He told me about it.

630
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:18,104
I see.

631
00:44:18,104 --> 00:44:21,649
But I don't think I can do it though.

632
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:22,942
You'll pay me double?

633
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,611
Well...

634
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:28,489
But for some personal reasons, I--

635
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:29,949
Quadruple?

636
00:44:32,535 --> 00:44:35,622
I do have some personal issues,
but I'll sort things out.

637
00:44:35,622 --> 00:44:36,623
Yes, I'll do it.

638
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:39,208
Yes, thank you for calling.

639
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,794
Thank you. Goodbye. Yes, thank you.

640
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:49,969
I do really need this,
but will I be able to do it though?

641
00:44:50,845 --> 00:44:52,555
But they said quadruple.

642
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:01,522
It's all done. I should wash these now.

643
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:03,483
<i>Family Outing</i> is ancient history.

644
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:05,193
Now that they've got Jeong-heon,

645
00:45:05,193 --> 00:45:08,780
the director and writer are
just set on enjoying an easy ride.

646
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,367
It's more like they've got
an easy theme and a good cast.

647
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:16,913
When I got the call, I assumed
that you'd be the head writer for sure.

648
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:18,956
There you go again, laying it on thick.

649
00:45:18,956 --> 00:45:23,127
Honestly, I don't know if this will work.
It's such a cliché.

650
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:25,046
- Woo-ju.
- Oh, hey.

651
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:27,423
They told us to hurry.
We've got a lot to do.

652
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,384
Yeah, okay.

653
00:45:30,635 --> 00:45:32,637
Can you not sneak up on people like that?

654
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:33,638
Right.

655
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,265
Listen, Ha-young.

656
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:39,268
I need you to send me
the pictures of the locations by tonight.

657
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:42,522
I should just wash them over there.

658
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,482
Hey, Min-gu. Turn on the water.

659
00:45:44,482 --> 00:45:45,817
- Okay.
- Hey.

660
00:45:45,817 --> 00:45:48,486
Let me do that. Here you go.

661
00:45:48,486 --> 00:45:51,280
The sieve-- Shoot, I forgot to bring it.

662
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,703
<i>You have to give speech lessons to a kid.
It's easy.</i>

663
00:45:57,703 --> 00:46:00,123
<i>Good luck.
I wouldn't have recommended anyone else.</i>

664
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:02,875
Get it together.

665
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,920
<i>Song Ki-baek, bite your tongue</i>

666
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,005
<i>If you can't
Look at the ceiling, distract yourself</i>

667
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:10,049
<i>Cry if you're about to curse
Think of the money</i>

668
00:46:10,049 --> 00:46:11,592
<i>Run away if it all goes south</i>

669
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,683
What is the power of words?

670
00:46:18,683 --> 00:46:22,145
How can being a good speaker
change your future?

671
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:24,689
How do you improve your speech?

672
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:27,567
The power of words is truly amazing,
so being able

673
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:31,404
to speak effectively can make
a significant difference in your future.

674
00:46:31,404 --> 00:46:32,572
IDIOT

675
00:46:43,624 --> 00:46:44,834
Brian.

676
00:46:48,296 --> 00:46:49,130
Brian.

677
00:46:50,923 --> 00:46:52,967
Wow, you managed to hold it in.

678
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:06,606
My family is rich, just like Iron Man.

679
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:14,906
Look, Brian.

680
00:47:14,906 --> 00:47:17,700
Look. Wait, Brian.
Let's take a seat, shall we?

681
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,993
Sit down.

682
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:21,954
Gross.

683
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:26,959
My mom's yoga instructor is here,
so she won't be coming in here.

684
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:32,423
Huh? What do you...

685
00:47:47,522 --> 00:47:48,940
I found it.

686
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:55,029
It's important. Where are you?

687
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:56,572
Where?

688
00:48:04,163 --> 00:48:08,709
I've told you many times to make
an appointment at the hospital.

689
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:11,879
I'm on vacation right now.

690
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:14,966
I'm in the middle of my temple stay.

691
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:16,467
I found the switch.

692
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:20,888
- The switch?
- It's sneezing.

693
00:48:20,888 --> 00:48:23,391
When I sneeze, I get out of control.

694
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:26,018
I turn into an unstoppably honest person.
I'm sure of it.

695
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:27,520
Sneeze for me.

696
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,605
I just did. The switch is on.

697
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:31,649
So turn off the switch and sneeze again.

698
00:48:31,649 --> 00:48:34,151
I don't know how to turn it off.

699
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:35,486
That's why I'm here.

700
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:40,283
Well, I can't help you
until I see it turn on, can I?

701
00:48:51,168 --> 00:48:52,878
The silence must run deep

702
00:48:53,671 --> 00:48:55,423
for the scenery to speak.

703
00:48:57,049 --> 00:48:58,384
The switch.

704
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:06,434
I think it may be an opportunity
to turn your life around.

705
00:49:06,434 --> 00:49:08,019
The switch, I mean.

706
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:09,186
The switch.

707
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:19,071
Do you think we're going to be okay?

708
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:21,616
Everyone's whispering
behind our backs, even the crew.

709
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:25,578
I'm sure Woo-ju is well aware
that our show is about to sink.

710
00:49:26,704 --> 00:49:28,247
I don't know anymore.

711
00:49:28,998 --> 00:49:30,958
We could be
out of a job before we know it.

712
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,168
What are we going to do?

713
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:36,547
I have to make payments for
another ten months for my washing machine.

714
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:39,634
We don't have any choice
but to trust Woo-ju, but...

715
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:42,970
Honestly, lately Woo-ju seems--

716
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,430
You're worried, right?

717
00:49:47,058 --> 00:49:48,934
Worried about what?

718
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:50,061
She's On Woo-ju.

719
00:49:50,061 --> 00:49:54,106
She's going to figure out a way somehow.
She never does things by halves.

720
00:49:55,733 --> 00:49:56,734
Hey.

721
00:49:59,278 --> 00:50:02,948
Just have some faith in Woo-ju
or what I say about her.

722
00:50:02,948 --> 00:50:06,202
You have nothing to worry about
as long as you work with Woo-ju.

723
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:09,121
Bye.

724
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:11,040
Okay, bye.

725
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:15,586
We'll be all right. Let's go.

726
00:50:16,712 --> 00:50:20,800
WE LIVE TOGETHER
MAIN HOST

727
00:50:28,265 --> 00:50:29,600
That's not enough.

728
00:50:31,143 --> 00:50:33,187
Is there anything fun we can do?

729
00:50:34,689 --> 00:50:38,275
I, too, want to do something original
that no one has ever seen, you know.

730
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:53,791
{\an8}SONG KI-BAEK

PREPARE NOW
TO ACT INSTINCTIVELY ON TEST DAY

733
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,174
What is this? A collection of wise words?

734
00:51:08,472 --> 00:51:10,891
"When in a tight spot,
birds peck at anything,

735

{\an8}animals harm humans,

736
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:18,899
Got it.

737
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,652
In that case, I'll just lie.

738
00:51:29,368 --> 00:51:32,830
The tragedy of everything that happens
from the moment you wake up

739
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,250
to the moment you fall asleep
being calculated, in terms of cost,

740
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:38,461
is incalculable.

JBC APPLICANT

00:51:41,922 --> 00:51:45,968
When you don't know what to do,
find something you'd never do.

743
00:51:45,968 --> 00:51:48,554
It actually sets you free.

744
00:51:57,062 --> 00:51:58,898
Okay, I think I got it too.

745
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:02,777
Song Ki-baek.

746
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:17,625

749
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,436

00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:03,128
Damn it.

757
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,608
This is driving me crazy.
Why is his phone off?

758
00:53:25,401 --> 00:53:26,569
Oh, look who it is.

759
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:28,612
- Tired?
- Can I have some water?

760
00:53:28,612 --> 00:53:30,573
- See you.
- Okay, bye.

761
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:31,574
See you tomorrow.

762
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:02,229
Stay calm, okay?

763
00:54:02,229 --> 00:54:03,439
Stay calm.

764
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:39,600
- Where were you?
- Where were you?

765
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,852
- This is it.
- Ki-baek, do you cook?

766
00:54:41,852 --> 00:54:44,063
- No. Ms. On, it was you.
- Can you sing?

767
00:54:44,063 --> 00:54:46,273
Yeah, pretty well.
Listen, I found the switch.

768
00:54:46,273 --> 00:54:48,359
- Can you dance too?
- I danced in college.

769
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:50,527
Stop asking these stupid questions
and listen.

770
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:54,239
Something you can't and don't want to do.
I think you and I can do it together.

771
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:55,866
This isn't the time to comfort me.

772
00:54:55,866 --> 00:54:58,869
Are you going to keep sitting around
doing nothing like a fool?

773
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:06,710
It's not like I want to do that.

774
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:22,351
What I meant was--

775
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:24,770
It's not like I want to
sit around doing nothing.

776
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,605
I know that. What I'm saying is--

777
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,148
But what can I do right now?

778
00:55:28,148 --> 00:55:32,403
All I ever knew was how to report
the news, but I've ditched that.

779
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:35,280
I've got no money, no home,
and no relevant experience.

780
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,699
What's left for me to do?

781
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:39,827
You have no idea
how miserable and hopeless I am.

782
00:55:39,827 --> 00:55:42,162
That's not what I was saying.

783
00:55:42,162 --> 00:55:43,330
Besides,

784
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:47,876
you can't be as miserable and hopeless
as I am, so stop and listen--

785
00:55:47,876 --> 00:55:50,879
You're miserable and hopeless?

786
00:55:50,879 --> 00:55:53,799
You're just insulting someone
who's actually miserable.

787
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:56,427
You want to talk about being miserable?

788
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:59,596
My junior writer is bossing me around
and has a bigger paycheck,

789
00:55:59,596 --> 00:56:02,016
and everyone is whispering
that I've lost my touch,

790
00:56:02,016 --> 00:56:04,059
and that I'm washed up
and have no authority.

791
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:07,104
I'm hanging on by a thread,
but I keep making a fool of myself.

792
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:09,440
Have you been electrocuted?

793
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,567
Do you know what it's like
to have your mouth

794
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:13,777
keep running like a busted faucet?

795
00:56:22,036 --> 00:56:24,413
That's what true misery is like, okay?

796
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:27,458
Like someone just smacks you,
making your eyes pop out.

797
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:29,460
You can't see, and you're bleeding.

798
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,838
Do you know what it's like
to have your ex suddenly show up

799
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:35,924
and you have to do what he says
because your job is in his hands?

800
00:56:35,924 --> 00:56:38,552
Or how it feels to force a smile
when you're dying inside?

801
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:41,055
- Well, I don't!
- Then shut up about it!

802
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:55,504
The switch is turned off.

803
00:57:58,215 --> 00:58:01,927
I can only turn it on again
after turning it off first.

804
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:18,777
Listen. Let's give this a shot.

805
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:45,971
Here we go.

806
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:48,015
{\an8}All right, careful.

807
00:58:48,015 --> 00:58:50,434
{\an8}HEAVEN HOUSE

808
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:57,774
Gather around.

809
00:58:57,774 --> 00:58:59,026
All right.

810
00:58:59,026 --> 00:59:01,820
From 10 to 11 a.m.,
you guys can have your breakfast.

811
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,779
Oh, hello.

812
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,206
See you later.

813
01:00:19,439 --> 01:00:20,857
FRANKLY SPEAKING

814
01:00:20,857 --> 01:00:23,193
<i>Reality dating show.</i>

815
01:00:23,193 --> 01:00:26,238
{\an8}<i>I'm sure they'll love
the real you, Ki-baek.</i>

816
01:00:26,238 --> 01:00:28,532
{\an8}I'm here to find a love
that's like a miracle.

817
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:30,617
{\an8}Like a miracle! You know.

818
01:00:30,617 --> 01:00:32,160
{\an8}I think you're really cool.

819
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,872
{\an8}<i>Kim Jeong-heon against ordinary men?
He's going to make you look like fools.</i>

820
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:38,709
{\an8}<i>There's something about being
at the shoot.</i>

821
01:00:38,709 --> 01:00:39,918
{\an8}<i>Reminds me of the old days.</i>

822
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:43,463
{\an8}<i>I don't want you to think
about the old days.</i>

823
01:00:43,463 --> 01:00:45,924
{\an8}<i>Who do you like the most, Ki-baek?</i>

824
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:49,344
{\an8}I'm upset.

825
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:53,098
I'm really upset with you, Ms. On.

826
